if you're new to Vue js, it's a framework that was released in July 2013, was invented for making user interfaces and it was developed by a developer named Evan You. it offers really helpful things like virtual DOM, components implementation.

if you take a look at the documentation for this framework you'll find that it's very helpful and easy to understand and it's one of the things that made its popularity going up. and its learning curve is not that long when you put it side to side with angular and react that's why a lot of developers love it.

And as with other javascript front-end frameworks, it makes client-side app creation very easy.

what is different in vue.js is that your HTML code is not written in a separate file but instead it's "mixed" with javascript/Vue code, and that's what makes it really efficient.

the question "is Vue js easy to learn?" is a really common question among developer people who are just finished learning Javascript or want to learn another framework for whatever reason.

 I've done some research but I just got a few posts that talk about it, and most comparisons between React and Vue are at least one year old.

## so is Vue js easy to learn?

you might be transitioning from using another framework like react or just finished learning pure javascript and you want to step up your programming skills, and you heard about Vue js and somebody told you that it's very easy to learn and that it has a really bright future ahead. so you wondered is Vue js really what they say about it? so is vue.js really easy to learn?

**Vue js is easy to learn and a lightweight framework, and that's because it uses components and also it has what it called templating syntax. it uses a great way of integrating HTML code with javascript in one file instead of writing HTML in its own file. another thing is that you can transition or migrate other projects to Vue.js very easily and very fast. even though it's a lightweight framework but it can do well for startups as well as with large projects.**

well, for me personally, it was really easy to pick up although I haven't learned any other framework before, I just learned some of the ES6 features and that was enough to help me learn its fundamentals and start practicing it right away, and you don't need typescript to start using Vue.

I have never learned react or angular but I always hear and read in forums and from other people that have learned other frameworks other than Vue js that it's the easiest one to learn, and the most thing that they tell you as a reason is that Vue.js is integrating HTML with javascript in a cool way that makes it so easy to work with it. and I also think it's very helpful.

react.js does integrate HTML with js but you have to add a compiler or a bundler first just like Angular. in Vue there is a method called <code>drop in</code> which is when combined with script tags you can build some cool applications with just these two things. don't get me wrong I don't advise you to do that but I just want to explain to you how much difficult React and Angular compared to Vue.js.

another thing is when you start learning Vue js you'll find that their documentation and official guide is really easy and simple to understand, you can pretty much depend on their guide only when you just starting to learn the basics. they also explain and demonstrate the data binding very well.

with other frameworks, you can't just copy-paste the tag and get started on your own Vue application, just head over to the guide and copy-paste the code then save it under an HTML file and it should work just fine.

here is a little demonstration that might help you get a clear picture of what I'm trying to say:

```html
    <HTML>
    <head>
        <!-- this is a development version, it includes some helpful console warnings -->
        <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/vue.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="vueApp">  {{ message }} </div>
        <script>
            var vueApp = new Vue({  el: '#vueApp',  data: {  message: "Hi There i'm Using  Vue!"  } });
        </script>
    </body>
    </HTML>
```

as you can see it's a single HTML page with copy-pasted code and there you go, you're using Vue js framework, I don't think anybody would find this to be hard.

here is the <a aria-label="Vue 2 guide (opens in a new tab)" href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" target="_blank" class="rank-math-link">Vue 2 guide</a> if you're planning to take a look at it, by the way, don't be confused by that number, there is version 3 but it's not as widely used as Vue 2 and might contain some vulnerabilities so just start with Vue 2 it's going to save you a lot of trouble.

## is vue js easy compared to react js

### Vue js and react Syntax

the way the Vue layer is built is so different than react and this is the biggest difference between the two.

in Vue there are two options in terms of how you want to write your app, it implements HTML templates but you can always have the option to write using JSX.

but React on the other hand only offers using JSX, if you're entirely new to frameworks then, JSX is a Syntax Extention to Js it's a template language that you have to learn in order to be able to use React, you might hear that JSX is optional but I promise you that you'll suffer too much if started learning React without learning JSX, and that's why people say that react is really tough when compared to Vue.js.

if you are still confused about JSX it's a language with a syntax similar to XML that combines HTML and CSS into JavaScript.

### Developer Insight regarding React and Vue

I want to talk about this because it really helps us sometimes to know what professionals in our field think of certain technologies, in this case, it can help you decide if Vue js is really easy for your capabilities and skills or if React is a better choice and it's not difficult for your case.

here is why professional web developers love Vue js:

- The easy and simple learning curve

- Elegant and clean programming style

- The documentation is really easy to understand

here is what professional web developers say about React js:

- Elegant programming style and patterns

- The ecosystem is really rich

- Widely used and popular

### my thoughts

like I said earlier, for me it was very easy to get into Vue js but you should not one thing which is that it's not as popular as React and that's why you're not going t to find a lot of courses out there and not as good as React ones, it's just a factor of popularity, but it's definitely <a href="/posts/is-vue-js-worth-learning/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="rank-math-link">worth learning</a>.

## is Vue js easy compared to jQuery

it's very common to see people start learning jQuery without learning vanilla Js, some beginners see it as a good starting point, I've talked in past about whether to <a href="/posts/is-it-necessary-to-learn-javascript-before-jquery/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="rank-math-link">start learning Javascript as a beginner or to go straight to jQuery</a>.

generally, the reason why beginners do that is that jQuery is very popular, and also some experienced developers find it easy to learn and they think that it's going to be a good choice also for beginners, but that's not a piece of good advice at all.

jQuery should almost for all people to be the second step after learning vanilla Javascript and that's why we'll compare it to Vue.

### jQuery offers conciseness, not simplicity

jQuery is definitely doing what it's made for which is helping with the issues that older browser have with JS support, and that's it, it's all that it's good for, when it comes to the DOM manipulation complexity it does help that much, and also for people who try to learn JavaScript by learning jQuery it's helping that much.

the syntax is shorter and cleaner when you compare it to vanilla Javascript but the same with Javascript you need to understand the same fundamentals of the DOM, such as event handling, DOM node selection, and so on.

so it doesn't offer simplicity, if you're a beginner which I don't think you're anymore, it's not going to be that easy to learn jQuery if you don't understand the DOM API and JavaScript fundamentals.

### Vue.js offers simplicity

Vue is still new in town. it offers a lot of features and has many strengths and one of them is simplicity when learning it is designed to be simple.

if I were a beginner again I think I could build a fairly cool Vue.js app along with understanding most of the code I wrote, but I think I could do that with jQuery, it's simply just not that simple to start with.

and as always coding can't be understood just by describing but you need some demonstration to get the whole point, so let's create a simple app for the purpose of comparison between Vue js and JQuery. it's simply an app that counts how many times a button has been clicked and output that value on the page.

**Implementing with jQuery**:

```html
    <div id="result"></div>
    <button id="add">add</button>
    <script>
        var counter = 0;
        $(document).ready(function() {
            var $result= $('#result');
            $('#add').click(function() {
                counter++;
                $result.html(counter);
            });
            $result.html(counter);
        });

    </script>
```

if it looks very simple to you then you're not a beginner that's why, but if you were to read this code back when you were just a beginner I bet you'll find it very tough to understand.

here are some of the things to take into consideration:

- the first thing you'll try to understand is this piece of code <code>$(document).ready(function(){...})</code>. and it contains 4 hard concepts which are Event handling, DOM node selection, callbacks, and document loading, you see how tricky it is, if you have jQuery in your skills list and you don't understand these concepts then you're just copy-pasting your code, and you have to relearn this the right way.

- to not make this look really negative jQuery only uses one pattern, which is you select an element and listen for an event then fire some function from the API. this is what we call a flat or one dimensional API, the problem here is that this one dimensional API has over 100 methods that take care of everything such as array iteration and Ajax and so on, that's why the names of the methods are not that descriptive for beginners so good luck with that.

- when you need to work with an element from the DOM you need to select it using the jQuery constructor which is this one $(). but in order to specify the exact node, you'll need to filter the result using a selector like CSS selectors, and you'll not know what you'll get until the script runs. of course, there is a solution to that but the point is that jQuery is a lot harder for beginners to pick up.

**Implementing with Vue.js**:

```html
    <div id="app">
        <div>{{ counter }}</div>
        <button v-on:click="increment">Increment</button>
    </div>
    <script>
        new Vue({
            el: '#app',
            data: {
                counter: 0
            },
            methods: {
                increment() {
                    this.counter++;
                }
            }
        });
    </script>
```

in contrary to jQuery's version of code the pain points are taken care of, if you haven't noticed yet then read the next:

- DOM complexity is not the thing to worry about in Vue.

- you don't need to draw the DOM on your mind like with jQuery since the link between Dom node and data property <code>counter</code> has been made. everything is in front of you, and you can freely modify the counter without worrying about missing the DOM due to the missy node selection in jQuery.

- the methods in Vue are not living on a flat API, but it's structured really well so that you don't need to remember these API methods, different functionalities are organized in the constructor object very nicely.

### the verdict

I don't want to persuade you into thinking that jQuery is very hard to learn but unless you got a solid understanding of JavaScript you'll face a really hard time trying to understand some advanced topics that should be thought in pure JavaScript. so if you're a beginner and you think jQuery is simple, it's not it's just abbreviated.

so when comparing Vue js to jQuery in terms of easiness of learning we found that Vue.js is a really easy-to-learn framework.

## reasons that make Vue js easy to learn

I really enjoy building Vue.js apps because of its simplicity to use, and here is why I love using this framework:

### 1. there is no required build step in Vue

this is the philosophy of Vue.js, it's built to get it up and running easily. and you don't need to implement some building tool to start using it like some of the other frameworks, as I said earlier it's as simple as adding a script tag and start using the Vue runtime.

```html
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue@2.5.21/dist/vue.js"></script>
```

so as you can see, the barrier to entry is very low, and this is what makes it a worthy consideration framework to learn.

### 2. Vue has a world-class command line interface

when it comes to the advanced features such as TypeScript transpiration, tree-shaking, and hot module replacement that got covered by build tools, Vue.js is also covering all of that.

```bash
    npm install -g @vue/cli \
    vue create my-project
```

CLI 3 was a huge update in Vue.js command line, CLI stands for Command Line Interface, the team behind Vue js re-wrote the CLI from the ground up which resulted in CLI 3, which was created in a way to support best practices and an easy to extend default Webpack configuration.

### 3. Vue js learning curve is very beginner friendly

it's true that Vue js API has a larger surface compared to another famous framework, this criticism is very common and I agree with that. another thing you'll hear more often is that Vue js is very easy to learn and that it has a beginner-friendly learning curve, this is not just from specific people with a specific level of programming but I hear that from beginners and experienced developers whether they've tried some other framework before or not.

from what I learned I think this comes from Vue's progressive nature.

unlike some other frameworks you don't need to learn the entire API to get started, and also don't need to learn another syntax such as JSX which is the case with React, you only need to know the basics which are HTML, CSS, and JS.

### 7. An amazing community

although Vue.js resources aren't many and most of them are not that good, especially when you face a feature that is difficult to understand, so if you are new to Vue you are not going to know which resources to learn from, I've used different resources and asked many developers on Twitter and Github and posted many questions in Quora, I totally forgot about the hard-working team behind Vue js.

until somebody on Quora asked me if I didn't know about <a aria-label="Vue forums (opens in a new tab)" href="https://forum.vuejs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="rank-math-link">Vue forums</a>, this was the best resource for me from that point, you can post the trickiest questions and still get the answer from experts.

so you don't need to know a lot of resources and a lot of Vue developers in order to solve the advanced issues in your app, other resources are <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://vueconf.us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="rank-math-link">VueConf.us</a> and <a aria-label="Vue Amesterdam (opens in a new tab)" href="https://vuejs.amsterdam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="rank-math-link">Vue Amsterdam</a>, those are a very good way to make some connections with other developers that are engaged in the community.

## takeaway

to make a conclusion of what I wrote above, Vue is definitely not hard at all if you want to start learning it and you know that already. it's designed to be very simple since it has simplicity built into it, some of the difficult stuff has been encapsulated, unlike in other frameworks. so even beginners are going to be able to write code that they can understand.

when it comes to state management, server-side rendering, and routing, Vue has the official packages for that along with support with updating. you can set up your project and prepare it to be deployed as fast as light with the CLI 3 version and Vue UI.

the last important thing I feel like I should tell you is that Vue js is just a framework and you don't have to worry too much about it, you'll always be using its syntax but JS is the most thing that you'll be using to write your control logic in, so focus on mastering your javascript skills more than learning frameworks.

> Frameworks like Vue js come and go but the fundamentals of Javascript are the only thing that almost always stays the same and it can help you learn any other framework if you master those fundamentals
