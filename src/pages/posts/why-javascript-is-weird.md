Even though JavaScript is one of the most powerful and popular programming languages, it also has a good share of oddities, which makes most people think of it as a considerably weird language. But why is this so?

**javascript is considered a weird programming language, if you compare it to other programming languages you'll find that it's really different, but even though it's strange it still solves problems in a really logical way.**

**here are the reasons why javascript is considered a weird language:**

- It is a strange contradiction
- JavaScript does not break complicated problems into smaller sections
- There is no integer type
- It’s more verbose compared to other languages
- When using JavaScript, Null is an object

## how Javascript is operating?

In the simplest terms, JavaScript is a scripting language that comes in handy when creating and controlling dynamic web content. This means anything that can refresh, move, or change on your screen without you having to reload the page manually.

Such content includes features like:

- Interactive forms 
- Animated graphics
- Autocomplete text suggestions
- Photo slideshows

An even better way to understand how JavaScript operates is to think about specific web features that you interact with every other day, even though you may have taken them for granted. One such web feature is the automatic updating of your Facebook timeline, and the other is when Google suggests different search terms that are closely related to what you have typed.

Even though these two examples of JavaScript in action make the language look quite simple to work with, the reality may be a tad far from that. The truth is that underneath the fancy results, there are lots of quite complicated things happening.

## How is JavaScript used to automate and animate?

As a scripting language, JavaScript works mainly by automating processes that would have otherwise required users to execute manually or step by step. The way JavaScript works to automate functions in webpages is by doing the heavy lifting which involves telling web applications or a full website “to do something.”

The “script” in JavaScript is the one responsible for making things seemingly happen automatically. That means controlling dynamic features such as making images to animate themselves. One thing to keep in mind, however, is that JavaScript is essential to web functionality, and as such, the majority of web browsers are equipped with engines that can translate JavaScript.

What this means for coders is that they can type JS commands into their HTML documents without having to feat that web browsers may not understand the commands. In simple terms, to write your JS commands into HTML documents, you are not required to get any additional compilers or programs to write your code.

## why is JavaScript referred to as a weird programming language?

There are varying reasons that make JavaScript a weird programming language, and these reasons vary a lot depending on whom you ask. All in all, the following are the most common reasons for JavaScript being referred to as a weird programming language:

### It is a strange contradiction

The contradiction is one of the things that makes Java a powerful and enjoyable language. As far as the strange contradiction of JavaScript is concerned, the main fact that proves this is that the programming language is single-threaded which means that it’s only capable of doing a single thing at a time. At the same time, however, it’s still an asynchronous language which means that it’s able to handle more than one task at a given time.

You may wonder how that is supposed to happen. Well, it’s pretty simple, and here is an analogy to help you understand better. Think of a scenario where you want to cook a meal in the oven that would take approximately 20 minutes, and you also wish to read a book. In the case of traditional programming methods, you would have to prepare the meal first, then eat once it’s ready, after which you can now read the book.

JavaScript is, however, different because in such a case, you can put the meal in the oven, then set a timer for 20 minutes, and read your book for approximately 20 minutes. Once the alarm has gone off, you would have to stop reading, head to the oven, have your meal, and then go back to reading.

The way JavaScript will reason in such a scenario is that since you aren’t accomplishing anything by just waiting at the oven, you can put that time to better use. Just like you can’t read and put your meal in the oven at the same time, JavaScript can’t also handle two tasks at the same time. It will have to handle one task at a time, which explains the single-threaded property.<br>As for the asynchronous property, if a task will take too long to complete, JavaScript will move on to the next task, while relying on a reminder to complete the pending task, once it’s complete.

### JavaScript does not break complicated problems into smaller sections

At its core, programming involves taking larger problems and breaking them down into smaller tasks that are not as complicated as the main problem, as an easier way to solve the main problem. JavaScript, however, is different since it takes on the larger tasks just as they are, and does not have control over how long it takes.

### There is no integer type

JavaScript is supposedly the only programming language that does not have an integer type. It has only one numerical type which is the (double precision) floating-point. While that may not seem like something to worry about, there comes a time when the lack of an integer type makes your use of the language quite problematic.

### It’s more verbose compared to other languages

Other than using dynamic scoping which the majority of programmers consider unusual, it is also more verbose compared to other dynamic programming languages like Ruby, Python, or Perl. As such, you may have to put in extra effort to understand the language completely.

### When using JavaScript, Null is an object

If you’ve chosen to use JavaScript, you may have to redefine your understanding of the word “Null”. Apparently, Null is an object in JavaScript, despite the definition of Null in normal circumstances being “the complete absence of a meaningful value.”

To heighten the confusion even further, Null isn’t considered as an instance of an object despite Null itself being categorized as an object. That’s in consideration that values in JavaScript are the instances of their base objects.

For example, a number in JavaScript is an instance of the number object, an object is considered an instance of the object object, and so forth. In this case, however, Null is not an instance of the Null Object, since there is no such thing as ‘Null Object’.

This may have some sense in it depending on how you look at it. That’s in consideration that if Null means the absence of a value, then it should mean that Null cannot be an instance of anything.

## takeaway

It’s right to consider JavaScript as a weird programming language since it’s considerably different when compared to almost every programming language out there. However, you want to keep in mind that the properties of JavaScript that make it weird are the same that make it one of the most powerful programming languages that you can ever use.

It’s obvious that learning and writing JavaScript will feel challenging, strange, and uncomfortable at first. However, as you gain more command of the language, you will understand it better and your use of the language will seem more intuitive. At that point, you will realize that JavaScript solves problems in the most intelligent, elegant, and even logical way.
