nowadays, the market needs are evolving too much and that's why new languages are being created constantly in order to satisfy those needs and build applications with advanced features.

not all new programming languages bring big changes that can help developers and services get better and do things easier. Javascript is a very powerful language has is 25 years old and still being in the top of the list. it's one of the best Front-End languages as well as Back-End. and that's why it's a very important language on the web.

javascript keeps evolving and becoming more and more powerful. developers and companies are falling in love with Javascript, and using it almost everywhere.

and that makes people wonder about the secret that is keeping popular all those years and still maintaining that, so what is the secret that makes javascript very charming and popular? and why javascript is so powerful?

**the reason why javascript is so powerful is that it's very flexible and evolving so much and keeping up with the rapid changes that happen in the web all the time, and also it can be used in a lot of domains wether it's Front-End Web, Back-End Web, Mobile, etc... also it has a lot of powerful features such as open-standard, ease of run and asynchronous functionality. also, Javascript is running on a V8 engine which very fast and flexible.**

like many other developers the first language I've learned after HTML and CSS was Javascript, it was a no-brainer since if you asked anyone what language to learn after HTML and CSS they would have told you that it's Javascript, that is how popular it is.

let's dive deeper to understand why is it so, I'm going to talk about all Javascript features and capabilities that make it so powerful and grab the number one spot in every developer's eyes.

## History of JavaScript

it's very crucial to understand where we come from in order to understand where we are at today and where we are heading, so it's crucial to understand the Javascript story although it's a long and bumpy road.

when the usage of the web started to boom in the 90s, a lot of companies started building their own web browser and compete to make the most powerful web browser on the market. the two big companies that were competing to dominate the usage share of web browsers, those two big companies were Netscape and Microsoft with their browsers Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator.

Netscape at that time was a very popular browser and competing against Microsoft, and Javascript was created to support it, as a companion language to Java.

programming languages back then were heavyweight and require deep training to be able to use them, so Netscape needed some lightweight scripting language so that programming would become easier, this made a huge change to the web accessibility were it became more accessible.

it all started 25 years ago in Netscape office where the first version of Javascript was born, just think about how the web landscape was very different at that time, most of the people who are reading this article were not born yet.

Netscape in 1995 chosen an employee named Brendan Eich to help with creating this lightweight scripting language and was given 10 days to do so, and that's what he did, he built the language and named it Mocha, which was renamed to Javascript later on. 

at that time, no one would imagine that Javascript would be a very powerful and popular language and dominate the web, it wasn't intended to become the standard language for the web. but the thing that made it happen is when AOL acquired Netscape and the Netscape Navigator code was turned over to the Mozilla foundation then Javascript started to get famous on the web.

When Navigator was dead (Netscape browser), all succeeding browsers like Internet Explorer (Microsoft), Firefox (Mozilla), and Chrome (Google) adopted it and started supporting Javascript.

Javascript is the most important web technology that almost all popular web browsers support, and each developer that wants to get good at web development especially front-end he has to be familiar with Javascript, and we can consider this alone as a reason why it's very popular and common used in Stack Overflow's Developer Survey for six years straight.

the web was really static since it was only using HTML and CSS, just to give you a hint about how the was at that time, here is an image that may clear the picture for you.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/why-javascript-is-powerful-0-1024x725.png" alt="old and static website" class="wp-image-311"/></figure></div>

the initial goal with creating Javascript as I mentioned above was to make the web a full-blown application platform, so Javascript can run on the client as well as server-side. but on the server-side, it wasn't taken too seriously and we still have many companies that use PHP and Python as a back-end language. but on the front-end, it was rapidly thrived and become the standard for the web.

many quirks had harmed Javascript adoption in the early years since it was born and developed in a hurry. but some of Javascript features still part of until this moment and those features are what defines the languages and what allows them to grow.

## Why is JavaScript so important?

so you want to know what's the fuss all about? 

as you know by now if read the history of Javascript Javascript was the language of the browser for a long time, it hasn't been that long since it became universal in the eyes of the development community. if you don't know... Brendan Eich the father of Javascript said some harsh words about the language in 2008:

> "*Many curse [JavaScript], including me. I still see it as a quickie love-child of C and *Self*. Dr. Johnson‘s words come to mind: “the part that is good is not original, and the part that is original is not good.*"

Javascript is now more present than ever before, it's almost everywhere. it's impossible to find a way around using Javascript in front-end web development.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/why-javascript-is-powerful-4-1.png" alt="graph of StackOverflow survey of the most commonly used language which is javascript" class="wp-image-302"/><figcaption>Source: <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020" target="_blank" class="rank-math-link">https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020</a></figcaption></figure></div>

you can also attribute the Javascript revolution to the ES6 (EcmaScript 2015) release, which is an update that happened to Javascript syntax, and also some good features had been added. this update allowed developers to do some really complex applications. 

however, this vibrant community and the rise of the web is what helped Javascript reach this level that it was never conceived to be.

## Why does the web need Javascript?

at this point you might ask why Netscape needed a whole new language even when Java exist, wasn't it enough?

Javascript was invented because Netscape needed a lightweight language but Java is very heavy for what Javascript meant for. scripters, designers who could adopt web development wouldn't find Java suitable as Javascript.

the invention of Javascript was to satisfy different audiences:

- Java professionals and component writers

- designers and scripters (front-end developers)

don't get me wrong there are no similarities between Java and Javascript today. the name of Javascript was an attempt to ride the wave of Java's popularity and that's to help speed up the process.

and the most important feature that Javascript was needed for in the web is that it makes it dynamic. you might not understand what dynamic really means, here is a list of things that could help you understand, things that Javascript added to the web:

- Autocompletion

- refreshing a score, rate, views, comments, etc, without refreshing the whole page

- validating forms inputs

- Playing audio and video

- and more...

Javascript is the first of it's kind, it's the only language that can be inserted directly in the HTML of a page. Javascript is understood by web browsers and that's what helps to create a powerful client-side experience.

> WebAssembly is also supported by modern browsers since 2017. it's a lanaguage that is designed to run in the browser alongside Javascript, it's a new type of language. 

Javascript has a dynamic nature and tight integration with the DOM, and that why it's a good language whether you agree or not. and that's the reason why it achieved this status and also because it's open and standardized.

another thing that is good about Javascript is that it's compatible with other languages. and the reason why this is super important is that webservers can run on different languages such as PHP, Python, Java, or .NET. the way Javascript runs in the browser is really different than how HTML web pages are generated and that's why it's always a rich experience as JS can work with any server-side language.

> for everyone that doesn't know a real feel of what JS is really doing for the web and why it's important you can try it right now by turning Javascript in your browser and see what your web experience would like without it.

## reasons why javascript language is so powerful

here are some reasons why Javascript is so powerful, I'm gonna try to weight all the reasons that I can think of so that you'll have a really good idea about how JS is really good for the web.

### V8 Engine: The beast powering JavaScript

you can think of V8 Engine as a car engine, it what's running JS in the browser and since Javascript is an interpreted language you should Know that V8 is an interpreter which interprets Javascript code. so a Javascript interpreter can be implemented as a standard interpreter, or just-in-time (JIT) compiler that compiles Javascript to binary.

V8 is made by Google as an open-source high-performance JIT engine for Javascript and WebAssembly. it was written in C++ and that's why it's fast, it's used in Node.js and chrome, and because it was written in C++ it can be easily embedded in any C++ application.

and this is what optimizes your Javascript code and converts it into binary code for your CPU, I'm not going to go through all the things that V8 does and how it works, but here are some tasks that V8 takes care of:

- Garbage Collection

- Compilation to Machine code

- Inline caching

- Pointer compression

- and much much more optimization

as a matter of fact, the 4th task on the list is not an old technique in the V8, what it does is it boosts memory optimization without affecting the performance. but when this feature has been added to the V8 engine it really improved its performance. BTW if you're into this kind of detailed information there is an official V8 blog that might be very beneficial for you to visit.

### Mature ecosystem and community

when it comes to the ecosystem, Javascript has one of the most mature if not the most ecosystems a programming language could ever have. also the community for javascript is huge and the entry barrier is extremely low.

just think about it if you've been using Javascript for some time, you just open a browser which is a piece of software that exists on every computer and you just open up the console and there you go, Javascript is waiting for you. it has never been that easy. it was never the case with any other programming language of such complexity.

as if the vast community was not enough, we also have the package systems such as yarn and npm. and there is a package for that on the npm registry, everything from creating random strings to handling streams and buffers in JS. there is a saying that is really famous among JavaScript developers:

> What can be done in JavaScript, you would eventually be able to do it in JavaScript

if you're a beginner in Javascript you'll notice that each question that you ask about a problem you face is already has been asked on forums like StackOverflow and already been answered many times, that's why the chance of falling into a problem that nobody has encountered before is very little.

the programming perspective is shifting from declarative towards imperative programming, and that's because Frameworks such as Vue, React and Angular are changing the way how future applications should be built, and this change is really helpful for developers since they can developer more quality applications more easily and without worrying about high performant code.

### Omnipresence: Javascript is everywhere

Javascript is present on many levels of programming:

- Front end (Browsers)

- Back end (Node.js)

- Android/iOS (React Native, NativeScript, etc.)

- Desktop (Electron)

- Hybrid (Ionic)

the thing that allows this is that V8 engine is written in C/C++ as I mentioned before.

### Bleeding edge features and advancement

the standards of Javascript are led by the ECMA-262 TC39 community, and those people are really fast at developing new Javascript features, ECMAScript releases a new Javascript standard every year. to give you an idea here are some features that might be included into Javascript in the future:

some of these features are requested by developers who use Javascript.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/why-javascript-is-powerful-2.png" alt="tc39 proposal of the most javascript requested features" class="wp-image-289"/></figure></div>

here is a link to all the proposals: <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="rank-math-link" href="https://github.com/tc39/proposals" target="_blank">TC39 Proposals</a>.

### JavaScript is Fast and Scalable

C/C++/Rust are the fastest languages and nothing can beat them, but Javascript also really fast, and that because the V8 engine as we said earlier can generate highly optimized code by monitoring how your code is executed, by delaying the bits that are not used and optimizing the others that are used over and over.

you'll see this more when you compare it to its competitors like Python and it's becoming more memory efficient and more performant.

Node environment is highly criticized for being single-threaded, but this single-threaded architecture doesn't matter as it is a highly scalable environment especially with supersets like typescript.

so in terms of scaling, scaling a single-threaded application like Node.js is not like scaling a multi-threaded application. if you think of the name "Node" that's really what it means, a single node in a tree of processors. and that's why it's scaled by running multiple instances of it and managing the cluster.

Javascript doesn't need threads to scale, it leads to the asynchronous event-driven model of the industry. what is happening instead is individual Node processes can be spawned in order to handle and use the entire CPU core. More on scaling Node later

### the high usage of Javascript

Javascript is being used as much as it talked about. it is the most popular technology in the engineering world, those are not my words but that's what a lot of data analysis platforms are saying and proving. and one of them is Github. Github is used by millions of developers, it's one of the largest repositories out there for developers. they publish analytics each year on how technologies on their platform are doing in terms of analytics in the year before.

only in 2017, they published some analytics that proves that Javascript is the most popular programming language with a high number, if you want to see this just google "Github's Octoverse 2017" and you'll find these analytics. and those pull requests are a very good indicator of the popularity of a certain technology since it shows you how much code has been written in that year.

under the same subheading which is the high usage of Javascript, there is another survey that was made by <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="rank-math-link">Stack Overflow in 2020</a>, and this survey shows that Javascript is the most commonly used programming language for 8 years in a row.

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/why-javascript-is-powerful-4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-296"/></figure>

and among other technologies like libraries and frameworks, the most commonly used ones were Javascript-based technologies such as Node.js, Angular, and React at the top of the list.

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/why-javascript-is-powerful-3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-297"/></figure>

let's look at some data from another analytics from Redmonk, it's a <a aria-label="survey from 2020 (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://content.techgig.com/redmonk-2020-rankings-python-overtakes-java-to-become-the-second-most-popular-language/articleshow/77304621.cms" target="_blank" class="rank-math-link">survey from 2020</a>. BTW if you don't know Redmonk it's an industry analyst company, it uses Github and Stack OverFlow to extract languages rankings and combine those two result together to in order to reflect both code and discussion traction, that tells a lot about the language. even though their rankings are not a statically valid representation of current usage, correlation discussion, and usage, it presents an insight into potential future adoption trends. in the rankings of January 2018, it shows that JS is talked about and used worldwide.

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/why-javascript-is-powerful-5.png" alt="" class="wp-image-298"/></figure>

another web technology survey is from <a aria-label="Web3Techs (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/client_side_language" target="_blank" class="rank-math-link">Web3Techs</a>, it reported that javascript is used by 95% of websites and it's the number one in the list of popular languages used on the client-side. what this data can tell us is that Javascript is one of the most popular programming languages on the web thanks to the browser's ubiquity.

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1605901197394_159"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/why-javascript-is-powerful-6.png" alt="" class="wp-image-299"/></figure>

### FULL-STACK DEVELOPMENT

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1605901197394_193"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/why-javascript-is-powerful-7-1.jpg" alt="full-stack development" class="wp-image-301"/></figure>

Javascript has dominated the web development technologies, but not just the web Javascript has another power which is its ubiquity. Node.js as the environment that runs Javascript in the back-end was released in 2009, and from that time "Javascript Everywhere" model has become a reality. this framework is what allows to unify web app development around one programming language which is Javascript so that you can have an application that used javascript in the front-end as well as the back-end.

the package manager of Node.js is the largest ecosystem in the world of open-source libraries. a lot of very popular companies including LinkedIn changing their back-end language for Node.js. after they shifted to Node.js their mobile application has become 10 times faster than it was before. that profs that Javascript is doing well also in the back-end.

### Trending In IOT

Node.js is becoming part of IoT use cases, it gained a lot of popularity in the eyes of many IoT companies since they're are integrating it into their projects, they found it very easy to use and doesn't break easily. it's being used not only for the project's server-side but also on the client device. being fast and has a lot of plugins and also it is scalable and very good at I/O (it allows to control IoT, can hold effective and secure communications), and that's why trending if you ask.

Javascript can also interact with a microcontroller and that's because a lot of engines provide all APIs to it. also, a lot of Javascript libraries are appearing in the field day by day and that proves the rapid growth of the usage of the technology. some of those libraries are Zetta.js, Cylon.js, Device.js, those are the famous ones in hardware engineering. and all of this is proving that Javascript is working everywhere.

### cross-platform mobile development

mobile development is another power side of Javascript you'll know that already if you know React Native. this library is what made Javascript very famous among mobile developers and take over the industry. it first appeared in 2013 as an open-source library and still, it introduced the possibility to build cross-platform mobile apps by combining React and javascript.

React got popular very fast and that was due to many benefits that it offers like saving a lot of o time by shortening the process of development, decreasing the number of human and financial resources needed, and also by being a Javascript framework since it makes it smooth to transition from web to mobile development.

sharing code and code-reusability is never been easier with using React native, it doubled its effectiveness. the nature of React Native is almost native and that's the strongest side of it, React apps look a lot like a native app was written in a native language even though it has been written in Javascript.

overall you can easily write two different apps by only using one language.

it's not just popular among developers but also many companies and popular apps are using react in their app's development like Facebook, Bloomberg, Instagram, and other apps. so now you know that Javascript is not winning on the web but also in the mobile development side.

### popular supporters and influencers

I mentioned this point in the subheading above but let's dive deeper into it.

so it's being implemented by major companies in the field such as Google, Alibaba, and Facebook and that's a reason why this technology has very high usage and this has a big role in its popularity, and of course, these giant companies use this technology for a reason which is making tasks handling and problem-solving very easy.

Javascript's unique feature is what powers it. its frameworks and libraries and other technologies are what give Javascript this power and popularity on every platform.

here are some web applications that are using Javascript fully in their development:

- PayPal

- Yahoo

- Netflix

- Godaddy

here are browser extensions that run Javascript under the hood:

- Adblock Plus

- HubSpot

- LastPass

here are some desktop apps that are built with Javascript:

- Slack

- Lightshot

- Mozilla

- Greasemonkey

for example, Paypal was built with Java and based on it but they migrated to Javascript and LinkedIn also has changed their server-side into Node.js, I guess there is no need to give more examples but generally, a lot of web apps and big companies changed their projects language to Javascript.

and this is where the concept of trend and influence underlies, when the industry leaders make these changes it makes Javascript appear more attractive to other developers and other small companies and that's how It gets popular very fast. as everybody thinks that major companies always go for the best technologies, which is almost always true since sometimes it can be only beneficial for that specific company but in this case, Javascript can work everywhere.

yes, I'll use the quote again:

> Any application that can be written in JavaScript, you can eventually write it in JavaScript.

— Jeff Atwood, Founder at Stack Overflow

### It is a modern language and still evolving quickly

Javascript brought a lot of features when it first was released in 1995. some of those features are garbage collection, closures, dynamic typing, built-in hash map, and functions as first-class citizens. you might think that these features are all the things that are expected in nowadays programming languages, but in 1995, we're talking 25 years ago back when they were rare.

another thing you must know is that Javascript was misunderstood and that's why it earned a bad reputation that stuck with it for a long time. they were some bad design decessions that played a role in this, but this was solved over time especially when ES6 came out in 2015.

the evolution of Javascript was catalyzed by the creation of babel by Sebastian McKenzie. and what's good about this is that we can now use bleeding-edge Javascript features before they can even be implemented in the browser. that saves a lot of years waiting for some features to be supported so that you can learn it and test it in multiple projects, some of those features are destructuring and generators. 

### JavaScript is considered as the assembly for the web

Javascript community is adding almost 400 packages to npm every day, one year ago in 2019 it had around one million packages in total. if you're looking for some library, tool, or a database adapter chances are it's already on the npm, since it's by far the largest and fastest-growing package repository on the web.

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/why-javascript-is-powerful-7-1024x418.png" alt="nmp packages number" class="wp-image-303"/></figure>

another thing is that each programming service has it's own support for Javascript, even if it's just a new startup.

and I said it's the assembly for the web because of its ubiquity in support, even new languages are choosing to transpile to Javascript and be executed in some browser or the Node environment.

also, there are lots of tools that are helping Javascript developers when coding with Javascript, such as typescript which is adding an optional typing system into Javascript, and another tool called JSX that makes writing React components very simple.

Javascript has done the same thing that Java was trying to achieve with JVM back in the 90s, which is becoming a single platform and covering the differences between various platforms and systems.

### Performance

in 2008 there was a big boost in Javascript performance, it used to be very slow but when the V8 engine came out this was changed, nowadays if you compare Javascript to C++ Javascript is only 2-7 times slower than C++ which is a positive thing, this is what makes Javascript the fastest dynamic language on the web.

as proof for Javascript speed, Paypal which is a huge application that was running on Java, when they migrated to Javascript their request per second was increased by 100% which double their previous speed. and that's why server-side Javascript has gained a lot of attention.

if you're wondering about the secret why Javascript is way faster than Java is because of its nature, if a server is doing thousands of simultaneous requests and connections, it's impossible to create a new thread for each one. Javascript has what it's called an Asynchronous non-blocking nature and that what makes it a good fit for high concurrency environments.

### Quick feedback loop

what I mean by Quick feedback loop is that it's really easy to open up the dev tools by pressing F12 and see what in the console, debugging never been easier in Javascript. and you don't even have to go back to your code editor and edit your code, you just change values and write functions using just the console itself and get the result right away.

the power of the quick feedback loop shows up when your app is running and you want to change something at the same time, it's possible with javascript and it's called hot reloading, it quickly shortens the developer's feedback loop. these short feedback loops increase your productivity which is what makes you happy and motivated when coding. and all of this is what makes your project go faster.

### Javascript is Scaleable

not having the same high-performance features of C or Java is a sure thing but it's easy to run in parallel because of its lightweight feature, and that's why it's suited to run on many cheap computers. and also the big advantage is that the horizontal scaling is way better than the vertical scaling.

### Asynchronous

this was a big problem before Javascript came with the solution, it was really hard to build an asynchronous program without messing up other factors, other languages were solving this issue by using threads, but the problem here is that threads make a program unpredictable and very difficult to write and debug, but Javascript solves this issue with promises and callbacks and that what gives you as a developer the control of the flow of execution.

### it gives Something for everyone

some languages like Go and Haskell are not bad but they fail at implementing multiple paradigms therefore they're not going to be as popular as Javascript, and Javascript is pretty good at this since it mixes Procedural, OOP, and Functional programming and this is what gives each developer some of what they want.

### provides great Performance

as I said earlier it's not the fastest language in the world but it's very fast and when you combine this with other features like Asynchronicity and scalability and the ease of use it makes Javascript handle most tasks easily.

### it's Easy to run

there is nothing simpler than getting your web server up and running in Node.js, it's pretty fast and requires little overhead, and runs pretty much everywhere, Windows, Mac, and Unix, the environment configuration required is very little, and it doesn't have a compilation step making it capable of running in Docker or cloud functions.

### javascript has Open Standard

the reason why Javascript has that steady flow of new features and having the freedom to grow with no agenda and simply being a better language is that it's not owned by some huge corporation like C#, swift, java, and Go, or there is a single party that has the control of it like Python. so being an open standard language is what affects the growth of a language.

### Easy to start

you might think that Javascript is really hard and you might hear even the experienced developers talk about how hard it is to master javascript, that's just the truth. but when you're a beginner you don't have to think about this at all since it's really easy to start learning it, if you just have tried some back-end language like Python you find a lot of similarities between them and that can also make your learning go faster and easier.

so Javascript is really easy to start but also really hard to master.

## takeaway

there are many factors that make Javascript popular and powerful but we can simply say that because it's the king of the web and the queen of mobile, it competes with the Front-End languages as well as with the Back-End languages, and also it's doing a good job even in the IoT (internet of things).

so it's a very powerful language and can do a great job in building faster and high-performing web apps, browser extensions, desktop apps, and mobile software as well. simply you can use Javascript almost everywhere, and because it's great at doing a lot of things and has an open-standard (it's not owned by some corporation), that why it gets better and better really quickly. and this is why it's very famous and powerful.
