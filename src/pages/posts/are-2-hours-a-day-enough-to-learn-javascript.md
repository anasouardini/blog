in recent years, a lot of people have become interested in learning Javascript, some of them found it through an HTML/CSS course, some of them found it in a web development roadmap, or just through some meetup. when learning Javascript beginners tend to have lots of questions such as how much it takes to learn Javascript or are 2 hours a day is enough to learn Javascript.

**2 hours a day are enough to learn Javascript basics, and learning the core basics of JS can take you 5 to 6 weeks, given that you know some of the basics in computer science and some prior experience of algorithms.**

**learning Javascript can take up to 6 to 9 months at maximum, but keep in mind that we said learning JS not becoming a master of this language.**

when I was just learning Javascript, I've tried spending 2.5 hours a day learning Javascript. and each time I almost stopped before time is finished. I kept doing that for one week then I quit for a month, and that's because I get totally burnt out after those 2.5 hours.

and another reason is that because most if not all the concepts were new to me back then, and that's what took me so long to learn Javascript. I didn't know that self-learning is harder than learning in school.

many factors can affect the time you need to learn Javascript, such as your previous knowledge of any web technologies, having a background of how to web works, and so on.

if you don't know anything at all it'll take much longer than if you already have some knowledge, unless you're a quick learner it's going to be relatively easy for you to pick up.

Javascript language is not designed only for one task, but it's designed to be used in a wide variety of cases. just to give you an idea, only in the web development field, it's being used in the back-end and the front-end.

and that's the reason why Javascript is hard to learn. it needs more time spent in studying as well as writing code and applying what you learned in order to be good at it and minimize the number of errors that are going to pop up while coding.

## so is it hard to learn

I wouldn't say that it's very easy or hard to learn but, if your background is so little when it comes to programming languages it's very common that you're going to face some difficulties here and there.

**so, JavaScript is not hard to learn, but if it's your first time learning a programming language it can take more time since you don't have the programming mindset that makes learning languages and other skills easier.**

**if you want a classification of JavaScript for being hard or easy, then JS is one of the easiest languages to learn especially when you're new to programming**.

## can you do 2 hours each day learning Javascript

after that you know that 2 hours a day are enough, here comes another question, are you capable of focusing 2 hours of learning straight each day? this depends on everybody's mind and also the mode that you're in at those two hours.

the first case is that it might be possible for you to do that but it makes you totally burnt out afterward, in this case, it might help to continue like this in order to speed up your learning, but most of the times you're going to quit and get frustrated very easily (after days).

but of course, if this doesn't apply to you, I mean that if you don't get tired at all and you can stay focused without getting burnt out and you feel after every two hours that you can put more time, then it's fine, you have found your suite spot.

and if you continue like this your brain is going to remember more than if you pushed your limits, and also you more unlikely to get frustrated.

the second case is that you can't even focus for one hour straight, then you can either divide that through the day, or if you don't have time because of your job and you have to spend some time with your kids then just go for what you can.

**the idea here is to not burn yourself out because that makes your brain believe that you can never do that and it's very hard for you to do and you're more likely to quit.**

I learned coding years ago and I felt the same way when I just started, it is totally normal. just don't focus on learning faster and focus on learning more (only what you can of course).

and rather than thinking of how many hours should you spend, you should make it a habit and make it consistent, if you have time I highly recommend you to check out **"THE POWER OF HABITS"**, it's a book that shows the impact of implementing habits in our lives, you don't have to buy the book, just look it up on youtube, you can find videos that summarize the book for you.

and just to make things clear even more, coding 1 hour every day in a consistent way is far better than coding two hours and then get frustrated, especially when setting your expectations very high, it's the easiest way to make yourself give up quickly. so don't plan to do 2-3 hours of coding, but plan for coding every day.

for those who need calculations, let's look at this example if you can code or study two hours a day, but one hour is in the morning and 1 hour after you get from work or whatever. if you can keep it like this it's 14 hours per each week.

one advice that I would give you is whenever you get burnt out, don't keep punishing yourself, but you can do something else to get rid of that frustration. or if you get bored by learning try practicing, because sometimes we can't focus because there is more theory than practice.

go apply what you learned even if it's not a lot, and do it your way because that could help you stay motivated.

## does it matter if you don't do 2 hours each day for 6-9 Months?

as I mentioned in the previous subheading, it's fine if you can't get your mind to focus one or two hours straight, and the most important thing is to stay motivated.

the thing is when you focus on learning concepts instead of keeping up with your timer, you'll find that some concepts are going to take much less time so you can learn 6-7 concepts in one hour, and some concepts have a lot of things that you have to understand about it in order to use it properly.

those hard concepts are less likely to get understood on the first try, and there is a lot of those topics in Javascript. like <code>*this*</code> keyword. you'll think that you understand it but after using it several times you'll be confused as if it's the first time you'll going to learn it. another feature is OOP, this one took me a whole day to understand it, I didn't focus on it for the entire day but I was revising it almost every hour or so.

so it's not important at all if you didn't finish those 3 or 2 hours that you planned to do each day. just focus on concepts instead. after you understand a concept or at least you think you understood it then go on and practice it until you have no difficulty or less difficulty at least then you can call it a day.

but in general, using hours to track your learning is not bad but a lot of time it's much better to focus on learning 1 or two concepts a day. but if you find that using your phone timer is simpler or easier just go for it.

so whatever suits you, is the best that can be done for your case. take into consideration that nobody is going to know how much information can you digest in a certain amount of time.

## Finding the right amount of time to code every day.

we talked about brain capabilities, now let's talk about the life responsibilities that can affect your learning process.

most of people that are trying to learn to code themselves have other responsibilities in life.

we mentioned before that you have to find the right amount of time for you to code each day, finding that amount of time can be affected by the responsibilities you have in life, not just the amount of time that your brain could stay focused. 

it doesn't matter whether you have a full-time or a part-time job, or you're just staying at home but you have other responsibilities that make you busy. so you have to figure out the right amount that you can code for every day.

if you're dedicated enough you'll find that time that you can sit down in from of your computer and try to learn some new concepts in Javascript. 

so you'll always find time for coding, even if you only have half an hour a day you can get away with it if you can stay focus and practice all that you've learned. we talked about your brain capabilities previously, so if your brain is capable of doing it then it's the right amount.

I don't want to make this much longer since I mentioned it the section before, but in general, you're the only one that can find the right amount to code every day.

I personally know people that are dedicating only 15 minutes a day and they've learned Javascript and they are relatively good at using it. the main reason is that they just put in the effort that is required.

and also I've heard there are people that depend on the university to teach them coding, but that takes them years instead of months. I hope you get my point.

there is this quote that i hear from advanced developer which is:

> It's not about your daily progress, but it's about progress daily.

so it doesn't matter how much time you spend but it's very important to progress in some way, and that's why I said before that you better focus on earning concepts rather on how much time you spend. just make it a habit that is stuck in your daily routine.

## Expect to Spend Months (Not Years) Learning JavaScript Basics

so now you know that it doesn't matter how much time you spend each day learning Javascript if you just focus on concepts. but you might ask if I kept going slowly it might take me a lot of time, yes it well and that's why I say "expect to spend months but not years", so you can set your expectations right about how much time it is going to take you to learn Javascript.

when complete CSS and HTML courses which are the basics of the web and can be learned in under a month, you might think that Javascript is a step up from the basics since it's not just about markup or styling, and you would think it would take you a lot of time to learn.

yes, it's definitely going to take you longer, but just expect to learn it in a matter of months, whatever your way of learning it, it could be books, online classes, youtube courses. 

you'll know by now that the time you dedicate, how many concepts you learn each day, and responsibilities in life is what really affects your Javascript learning time, you can add this to the list, the methodology that you're using, it's another small factor that can affect your learning.

to keep it short, choose whatever methodology that helps you get the most out of your brain. if you are ok with reading, it's better to read posts and courses that are written, and if you get tired from reading very fast, use videos on Youtube, etc.

now you have set your expectations right, so if it takes you like 6-7 months you should start to think if you've missed a lot of days, or the methodology that you're using is not helping. by the way, it's very normal if you passed a day without learning any concepts at all, it happens from time to time.

but remember that we're talking just about learning Javascript so that you can use it properly, but if you want to master it might take years depending on the level you want to reach in Javascript because the knowledge that senior Javascript developer has is a lot more than what a junior developer has.

 just don't put a lot of pressure on yourself, especially in the beginning where you can't find the balance between being lazy so you do not learn anything throughout the day and getting burnt out from too much strictness.

## The balance between not making enough progress and getting burnt out

 if you're just started learning Javascript, which you are unless you're not going to be reading this article, you'll face a hard time finding the balance between burning yourself out and not progressing in your learning.

finding that suit spot helps you learn faster without giving up since you're not going to be frustrated. learning Javascript with this balance not only going to make it easier but also make fun, especially that is going to be injected into your daily routine.  

but finding this balance is not easy for someone who's just getting started, so it requires some testing. each day you learn a concept or two, just think if you had any thoughts about stopping or if you lose focus a lot and notes like that. by the way, studying in the morning is keeping you focused more than evening if you could use that it'll be helpful.

you're going to have some days that you can't understand even one Javascript concept, and your brain is just can't process the information that you read or hear. so if you kept trying to force it you're just going to get burnt out very easily. so the best thing to do at these kinds of moments is just resting a bit and taking a deep breath, and maybe go make a cup of coffee.

as time goes on, you'll learn to remind yourself each time to not overwork it until you can't focus again. you can think of our brains as muscles, they also need some rest in order to recover.

I don't want you to think that Javascript is really hard but, it not that easy either. you need strong focus, especially at the beginning since all the stuff you're learning is new to you.

and also if you're not in a good mood, do something that makes you in a good mood like playing music as you're practicing. because if you faced a problem even if it's very simple, you're not going to figure it out if you're angry or frustrated.

you'll face a lot of times when your code is not working although it's the same as the one that you say in the video, or simply it works but you have no idea how it does as you think it should not work, you might find the second one a bit strange but you'll face it sooner or later.

so the key here is to enjoy what you're doing, **you can try this, whenever you name a Javascript variable or sending a message to the console, name it something funny. that what was helping me back then since it makes me really productive, it might work for you too.**

you might hear over the net developers that talk about the **50/50 rule**, a lot of what we're learning today is quite complex, if you don't know this yet take a look at structures and algorithms, I'm not trying to scare you but it's the fact. here where the **50/50 rule** comes up.

**it's all about using your time in 50/50, 50% of your time for tasks like studying basics, algorithms, and things that are a little bit difficult, and use the other 50% in practicing and doing your own personal project that has your touch in it**, which is much easier than the first 50%. you'll notice that there is a balance in your studies when it comes to day-to-day learning.

you'll hear about people who learned to code and had a job along with having a full-time job and a family to take care of that's really hard to do. I personally let the family thing till I get my career in order.

if you think like me; I call it being human.

try your best my friend, you always should, but do not exhaust yourself.

 Good luck!

## you'll learn Javascript faster if you know some back-end language

I've talked about this in an article called <a href="/posts/is-it-easy-to-learn-javascript-after-java/" class="rank-math-link">is it easy to learn JavaScript after Java</a> where I mention some features about the back-end languages that can make it really easy for you to pick up another language like JavaScript. 

learning any programming language will teach you the basics such as Variables, Functions, Loops, etc. you're to come across these basics when learning any other Programming language. so if you have some experience with PHP or Python, Javascript will be easier to learn than if you don't know anything about programming.

so if you have those basic Concepts understood, you just have to learn how Javascript is implementing them, or in other words the Javascript syntax.

and the syntactical stuff shouldn't take you more than a week or two then you get to the advanced stuff that really differentiates Javascript from other languages, such as Closures, APIs, Prototype chain, Event Loop, then ES6, that's if you want to start with ES5 first.

if you're confused about whether to start with ES5 or go straight to ES6 check out this topic that walks you through it,Should You Start With <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="/posts/should-you-start-with-es6-or-es5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="rank-math-link">ES6 Or ES5</a>.

now all the things that I just mentioned about how easy it is to start learning Javascript when you have some knowledge of the basics that you get from other languages are totally true but, don't expect Javascript to be too easy because of that.

a lot of people that are starting to learn Javascript also have experience in PHP or C# or any other language, so they think that everything that they learned in PHP for example is totally working the same way in Javascript, which is a really big misconception.

I only tell you this to not set your expectations too high, and also to not be one of the people that say Javascript is a poorly designed language just because they came from another language.

for example, when learning "this" keyword, they don't try to understand it or learn how Javascript implements it, but the first thing they say is oh man I already know that and they skip it just because they've learned it in Python or Java.

I don't want you to think like this. when they try to practice what they've learned they realize that things aren't working as they expect them to. then they blame Javascript for being weird.

so, coming from other languages means having the basic understanding that is going to help you with learning Javascript. but it's not a shortcut around the hard work that you have to do anyway.

## do you want to master Javascript or you just want to learn it?

to keep it as short as possible, **mastering javascript can take you years**, and if you're going really slow like I was doing.

I learned the basics then started freelancing for a year then came back to learn some framework then I found out that I need to learn ES6 to make learning frameworks easier then I learned the new features of ES6 and it was helping me a lot then I came back to freelancing for months and I learned a framework and here I'm, **I'm no way near being a master of javascript**.

but if you just want to get a job it's fine to learn some basics of ES5 (the first version of Javascript) which going to take you a month or month and a half as I said before, then ES6 (javascript 2015) which is going to take you the same if not less.

- **if you're interested take a look at** <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="/posts/should-you-start-with-es6-or-es5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="rank-math-link">should you start with ES5</a> or just go straight to ES6.

## takeaway

dedicating 2 hours a day is enough to learn Javascript as a beginner if you kept at it for a month or month and a half. you just have to know some internet basics and you should probably know them if you have learned HTML and CSS.

to summarize this, the only one who knows whether 1 or 2 hours are enough to learn Javascript because everyone's circumstances are different than the other.

and a lot of factors are affecting the difficulty of your learning, such as whether you know some back-end languages or not if your brain can stay focused to get out the most of those two hours, do you want to just learn Javascript and use it properly or do you want to be a Javascript master, and so on.

so as I said the best thing to do is to find a balance between working really hard till you get burnt out and not making any progress.

also, you have to set your expectations right, expect to spend months learning Javascript but not years, if toke you longer then you're doing something wrong. and also it's doesn't matter if you can't do 2 hours a day and also if can because the important thing is whether you've learned any concept or not.

that's it, keep up the hard the work and you definitely going to see the result.
