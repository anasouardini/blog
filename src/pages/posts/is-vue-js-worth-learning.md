Released in 2014, Vue.js popularly known as "Vue" is a front end Javascript framework that enables developers to build single-page apps and user interfaces. For starters, a Javascript framework is a collection of JavaScript code libraries that contains a pre-written Javascript code that a developer can use in building a website or web application.

## Is Vue.JS Worth Learning?

With so many Javascript frameworks that are not user-friendly or reliable being available, it's easy to wonder as to whether or not Vue JS is worth learning. Frankly speaking, it is and here's why:

**Contrary to other JS frameworks such as Angular or React, Vue is very easy to learn and master. If you need to pick a JS framework that is quite simple to learn for your next project, VueJS is arguably the best choice. The only downside to this program is that many developers aren't well acquainted with it. So, if you are working as a team of developers who don't know how to use it, you may have a hard time convincing them to learn this technology.**

**Remember that many developers prefer to stick to one particular framework. Many of them are into either Angular or React, which are unfortunately more popular than Vue.**

**Vue.JS is really worth learning in 2020 and the years that are coming, since it's growing really fast even if it's just got released "yesterday" compared to other frameworks on the web. don't hesitate to learn Vue js just because a lot of companies haven't transitioned to using it yet, it more likely because they can't afford that in the meantime. this technology is very fun and worth your time.**

matter of fact every framework is worth learning, just pick up the one that suits your skills and knowledge and also your feelings towards it, javascript is so strong and popular especially in the front end web, here is an article that I wrote on <a href="/posts/why-javascript-is-powerful/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="rank-math-link">why javascript is so powerful</a> that shows how much javascript is powerful and popular and the reason behind that.

## Reasons That Make Vue.JS Worth Learning

### Scalability and Flexibility

In software development, scalability is a very, very important element. It refers to the ability of the tool being used in developing software to increase its capacity as well as functionalities based on the developer's demand. In addition, it describes the ability of that particular tool to remain stable while adapting to changes, overhauls, upgrades, or resource reduction. Flexibility is an element of scalability.

Scalability is one of the top considerations in choosing a Javascript framework for your website or application development project. Obviously, different JS frameworks have varying levels of scalability. For many developers, a framework with a high level of scalability is more worthwhile than one with a low level of scalability.

Vue is as scalable and flexible as it can get, thanks to its dynamic structure as well as components. As such, you can pretty much arrange it, change or update your software or app however you like without having to go back to the drawing board and make significant changes.

### Ease of Work

In software development, there's something called "Boilerplate code". For starters, this is a longer-than-necessary code that is written just to accomplish minor functionality in a software development project. A boilerplate code is inevitable when developing software, using a verbose programming language(a programming language that uses too many words) such as Javascript.

Though some developers dislike this because it compels them to write a code that is longer than necessary, verbosity makes a program easy to debug. Fortunately, Vue helps you avoid this kind of work when using JS by offering built-in, effort-saving solutions. You can read this insightful post(https://blog.bitsrc.io/10-top-vuejs-boilerplates-for-2020-c70192003d20) to learn about the top ten boilerplate code solutions offered by Vue. Js.

### Vue Makes Updatability a Breeze

It's worth learning Vue. JS because this Javascript framework will remain useful even after you develop and deploy your software. Remember that you'll need to keep performing maintenance for your software on a routine basis to fix bugs, add new features, and provide other improvements to make it better suited to your users' needs.

The new releases for Vue are made with backward compatibility in mind. Just to be clear, backward compatibility or downward compatibility is a characteristic of a software development framework that makes its new features compatible with older legacy systems. You will hardly have to upgrade your system to a new version of Vue to be able to benefit from its new features and functionalities.

### Built Without the Mistakes of Other JS Frameworks

Every software product will have a few initial errors here and there that negatively affect its performance. Unfortunately, some of these errors cannot be fully fixed even in the successive versions. Angular was initially released in 2010 while React; 2013. Each software had its own set of errors that have not been entirely resolved even in their later versions. In other words, those errors are here to stay.

The fact that Vue was developed later than Angular and React puts it ahead of the curve. That's because its developers had the opportunity to learn from the mistakes that these earlier JS frameworks came along with. Those errors cannot be found in it!

### Wider Integration

Just as other popular Javascript frameworks, Vue can be integrated with a wide range of other JS frameworks to achieve extended functionalities or customize a project according to their requirements. For example, it can be easily paired with Angular or React to achieve that. It's another reason why this framework for JS is becoming popular with developers.

### Promising Future Prospects

Owing to the many advantages that Vue offers over other similar Javascript frameworks, the future for this software looks brighter than that of other JS frameworks. It's evident that many clients will prefer it to other options for their projects. This means that developers with the skills for it will be in high demand. Those developers are very few, mark you.

## Final Thoughts

Taking the advantages of Vue over other JS frameworks, it's safe to say that this software is a greater option than the rest. For example, it's more scalable and flexible, makes your work easier as a developer, not to mention that it's easier to update. Also, this software is with fewer flaws plus it offers a wider integration. Lastly, learning it now sets you on a path to a more rewarding future career. As Vue becomes more popular, there's no doubt about the fact that those who have the skills for it will soon be in high demand. With that said, I think it's time for you to start learning Vue.
