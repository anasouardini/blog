If you thought that only non-tech people confuse JavaScript with Java, then you need to think again. New programmers are also finding it quite difficult to distinguish the difference between the two. Although each of the two terms refers to a programming language, each has multiple strengths over the other.

**For starters, Java is an OPP language, while JavaScript is specifically an OOP scripting language. Note that JavaScript code runs on the browser and desktop thanks to the Node.js environment while Java creates applications that run on the desktop, it can also run on the desktop but it's not as efficient as Javascript. JavaScript can be used by programmers to do neat things including creating animation in HTML.**

However, understand that one isn’t primarily better than the other; most programmers use both of the languages for a variety of tasks. Well, today we will take a comprehensive look at the differences between Java and JavaScript.

## the history of JavaScript

Did you know that Netscape Navigator and Explorer were the top web browsers in early 1990? Within 10 days of the Netscape Navigator launch, the developer Brendan Eich was able to design a language that could interact with the user. Note that this programming language was referred to as ‘LiveScript’ because users got feedback upon receiving user input in the browser.

What this means is that your browser at that time was interpreting the commands of the user. The code didn’t need to be compiled and there was no need for a plug-in. However, during this time a different programming language was gaining a lot of popularity: Java. Netscape decided to use this opportunity to market their programming language. Brendan Eich, therefore, changed the name from ’LiveScript’ to JavaScript.

## the history of Java

James Gosling invented the Java programming language, but it was developed by Sun Microsystems. However, Java took more than 10 days to develop since it involved several components. This programming language was developed in about four years by a team called the ‘Green Team’.

According to several researchers, the ‘Green Team worked on the project day and night to ensure its successful launch. It was first released back in 1995 and several new versions have rolled into the market since then.

Today's internet is full of Java-run programming, which makes it quite popular. It is also worth mentioning that many applications are created using Java programming language. Currently, Java is owned by a company known as Oracle.

## Key Differences Between JavaScript and Java

Understand that JavaScript and Java are assembled, written, and executed differently. Each also has significant differences when you look at their capabilities. Let us take a deeper look at the differences to help you distinguish between the two.

Java is applied in many different places including creating desktop applications, credit card programming, web enterprise applications, and Android apps. JavaScript, on the other hand, is commonly used to make web pages interactive. Although Flash can also be used interchangeably with JavaScript, the latter is preferred by programmers because it has more functionality. With JavaScript, programmers can create animation in HTML to help boost the user experience.

It comes down to the use to distinguish Java from JavaScript. While JavaScript is mostly used for developing client-side scripts, Java is typically used for server-side development. Below are the primary differences between JavaScript and Java.

- Each language needs different plug-ins

- JavaScript is all-text while Java must be compiled

- Java is an OOP language while JavaScript is an Object-Based scripting language

- Both Java and JavaScript are creating apps that run in the browser and desktop but Java is more powerful on the desktop while JavaScript is more powerful on the browser

## Similarities Between JavaScript and Java

Although the two languages have several differences, they also share some similarities. Understanding the similarities will help you understand the two languages on a surface level. Here goes all the similarities between JavaScript and Java:

- Both JavaScript and Java use the popular C syntax

- Both JavaScript and Java are used in client-side applications

- JavaScript includes several Java naming conventions

## Which of the Two Should I Learn?

Choosing between learning Java and JavaScript can be a huge nightmare. Most individuals don’t know which language to learn first, and why. Understand that choosing between the two is like comparing oranges to apples. There is no wrong or correct answer when it comes to choosing between learning Java or JavaScript.

If I had to choose between which programming language to learn first, I would pick JavaScript. According to GitHub, more repositories had been created in 2018 in JavaScript than any other programming language.

According to the same report, Python and JavaScript are significantly growing in popularity over the years when compared to other languages. Ruby, for example, is picking up much slower than the rest of the languages that have been developed recently.

However, this doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t learn Java. Understand that Java is very popular and widely used in the programming world. Other experts would argue that learning Java is advantageous since its uses are greater.

If you are a beginner, I would advise you to start with JavaScript before moving to Java. Understand that JavaScript is an important skill that can be applied in several tech-related roles. Regardless of the type of job or tech position that you find yourself in, JavaScript will always help you get things done effectively and efficiently.

Because these two languages are fairly different, deciding on which to learn is never an easy task. If you still aren’t sure, then try thinking about your career goals. It will also help if you weigh all the pros and cons of each programming language before taking a class. In the end, it comes down to your personal preference and career path.

## Conclusion

A new programming student will quickly learn that both JavaScript and Java are worthwhile languages to acquire. According to experts in the programming field, it is beneficial to learn both of these programming languages simultaneously.

You will become more employable and skilled when you learn both Java and JavaScript. It will also help if you learned other programming languages in the field. Ensure that you keep up with the changing times and improvements in coding.
