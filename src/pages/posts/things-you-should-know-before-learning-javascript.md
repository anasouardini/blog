so you're planning to learn Javascript for the web and you're wondering about what technologies and concepts should you understand before you start learning Javascript. and that's what I'm going to talk about in this article. so what are the things that you should know before learning Javascript?

**before you learn Javascript you need to understand web fundamentals such as HTTP/HTTPS, TCP/IP, how a browser is working, etc., and also you have to learn HTML and CSS languages since those are the basics of front-end web development.**

with that short answer, you'll know what you have to do but bear with me if you can so that you'll get the whole idea, all the information that you'll need down the road.

you're going to thank yourself later when you come across people who skipped this really important step, and they just have that surface knowledge and they keep asking you about the simplest things in Javascript since they didn't understand the basics of the web.

lat's talk a bit about some small things that you should know before learning javascript, **these three things are really important things that you better to understand before getting to the technical stuff.**

## What should I know to learn Javascript?

**To learn JavaScript, you need to know these three essential things:**

### 1. Where are you with regards to JavaScript?

you should determine your level with javascript, to know that you should ask yourself these questions:

how much time did you spend learning Javascript? do you just copy-past Javascript code from online forums? are you OK with writing Javascript code from scratch without getting back to your notes?

**you typed this question in google for one reason which is that you don't have a map of what you need to learn** which is what you'll find in this article. but first, you really want to know where you're at with learning javascript.

this is only the first step and the first thing you should know and check before you get to the second and third step.

and this brings us to the next thing:

### 2. Where do you want to get to?

what's the reason and motivation that pushes you to learn Javascript, people learn javascript for different reasons such as trying to build a website or you have one and you're just trying to make it more dynamic and interactive by learning javascript.

the reason you try to learn javascript for is different than another person who is trying to do freelance or trying to build a web application.

so you're learning javascript for a reason and you should know that reason, that thing should be the end result from learning this language which could be as simple as creating a script that helps you calculate something that's repetitive, or as complicated as building some booking website.

**whatever you do just don't fall into** this trap which is that you set your goal to "learn enough javascript to get hired", this is a big mistake, if you do this I guarantee you that you'll be lost since every company hires web developers based on different things. you can get a job with a company with fewer skills than other developers who didn't get hired.

so it's important to know your end goal and then you can build a list of things that you need to learn in order to get to that goal.

### 3. What’s the shortest path between these two points?

let's see that you've decided on your list of things and steps you need to go through to learn Javascript the way that gets you to your goal. the path that you'll need to go through might look straight until you really go through it step by step, I'm not trying to scare you but it's a normal thing.

any learning map has its own winding paths. you won't know them when you just get started but it's better that you expect that as if you don't, you're going to face those curves and it might discourage you from keeping up, which is what happens to a lot of people who are just starting to learn any skill that's new to them.

I personally restarted learning javascript about three times, so it's a normal thing as long as you're human.

this is why people who have a mentor that goes through this with them learn faster than others since the mentor knows the landscape you're lost at, and that mentor shouldn't be one you can just use Quora, Stack Overflow, Reddit, and other platforms that helps beginners and intermediate developers with a problem that they face when learning javascript or any other language.

another thing to know is it's ok to take that winding path alone and it's possible but it's a little bit harder.

when it comes to learning javascript here is the full path that you should go through before you learn javascript to make things easier for you in the long run.

## Learn web fundamentals Before Learning Javascript

I didn't learn those fundamentals before learning Javascript, I just learned **HTML** and **CSS** then I quickly moved to learn Javascript, and that's what got me into trouble, I learned web fundamentals along with learning Javascript and PHP, but this is the hard way.

so it's better to learn them first, it's not going to take you more than a day, but it's going to save you a lot of trouble down the road.

**you need** to understand what does **HTTP** means and read about this protocol and you should know the difference between **HTTP** and **HTTPS**, also there are courses that teach **TCP/IP** but you don't need to go through the whole course just the intro would be enough.

**and also** you need to know how browsers are displaying that graphical interface and how engines like the V8 engine works (V8 engine is what runs your js code inside your chrome browser). another thing is good to know how servers are communicating with each other.

Javascript is not just for the front-end, it can also run in the back-end using the Nodejs environment which is built using that same **V8 engine** that google has built so if you know how it works you'll know how Javascript is working also in the back-end.

**also** when you're learning Javascript you'll need to know what are **cookies, sessions, and local storage**, so it's better to read about them a little bit so that you'll have to learn just the syntax when learning javascript, instead of having to look for videos on Youtube that explains that.

i don't want to make this section very long, but I just want you to know that it's very important to not skip the basics which I always was guilty of it, I can't stress that enough, but there you have it for the web fundamentals, that's all that you got to learn before getting into Javascript.

**here is a list of these web fundamentals:**

- HTTP/HTTPS
- TCP/IP
- how browsers work (browser engines)
- cookies, sessions, local storage
- how servers communicate (optional)

web fundamentals don't end here but those are the most things that you're going to need to know before learning Javascript, the other fundamentals are not necessary for now, but you'll learn them when you get to the advanced stuff.

remember that it's all meant to making your learning go faster without skipping anything, slow is steady, steady is fast. by the way if you're wondering how long it might take you to learn Javascript, you can check out my article about that, <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="/posts/are-2-hours-a-day-enough-to-learn-javascript/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="rank-math-link">How Long It Takes to Learn Javascript</a>

## You Should Know HTML and CSS Before Javascript 

it very important to learn these two technologies if you're planning to learn front-end web development, you might think it's obvious that you have to learn HTML and CSS before learning Javascript but a lot of people don't know that they have to learn them very well before jumping to Javascript, and I did that too, I spent 3 days to learn HTML and CSS in a crash course.

so don't do what I did and avoid crash courses unless you already know HTML and CSS and you just want to revise them. for example, you'll be doing some unnecessary stuff and adding some Javascript lines for a really simple task which can be done just using CSS, and also there are properties and tags in HTML that can help to manipulate the DOM with just a few lines, so if you don't know these features you're going to spend a long time doing that with Javascript and fixing unnecessary errors.

as you know HTML is a markup language that creates the DOM elements for your web page, but nowadays it has some really nice features that help reduce your use of CSS, so you're not going to regret it if you really learn HTML as it should be learned, so keep that in mind.

also CSS still a styling language that styles your DOM elements that you create with HTML, but also it has some changes recently that will help you with reducing the lines of your Javascript code and also its complexity and some of those features are counters, variables (custom properties),  `is()`, `matches()`, `any()`, scroll-snap, and so on, some of them are not supported yet in all browsers and also are a little bit advanced but you get the point.

even though doing everything in Javascript is going to help you a lot to have a solid understanding of javascript language, but knowing those features is going to make a better developer overall, and Javascript skills can be enhanced by many exercises and challenges.

## learn vanilla Javascript before getting into libraries and frameworks

this is the best advice can someone give you since you're just got started, I wish someone told me this when I just started, don't ever skip vanilla Javascript when you start learning Javascript, you'll regret it if you jumped to learning libraries and frameworks without a solid understanding of the vanilla code.

just master the basics of Javascript so that when you move to learn frameworks you'll find it easy to pick up,  you'll just need to learn that new syntax.

Javascript is the number one programming language for the web, so you really have to understand its core principles and concepts in order to get a decent career on the web. of course if your goal is to be ahead of other developers.

more than 11 front-end Javascript frameworks made the news in the past 6 years. just think about how many frameworks are going to do the same in the next 5-10 years, if you're just pretending to know Javascript which is the engine that powers this web revolution, then how would you keep up with it?

just think about jQuery web developers and what are they doing today, they're trying to catch up on react, after react dies they'll try to catch up on Vue, and so on. their sad depressing loop goes on.

one tweet that i found on Twitter yesterday when doing  research for this article is from @iamdeveloper, he said:

> "Maybe switching to [insert a new Javascript framework] will compensate for my lack of actual JS Knowledge" - front-end web developers in 2020<cite>@iamdeveloper</cite>

if your Javascript knowledge is very strong you can even contribute to Javascript frameworks or even make your own if that's a thing that you're interested in. and you'll know which framework suits you when you need to learn one.

I can't stress this enough, but there are lots of benefits.

here is an article that I wrote that talks about all reasons that might or might not make you learn jQuery before learning Javascript. when it's fine to learn jQuery before learning Javascript and when it totally wrong to do that, here is the article, <a href="/posts/is-it-necessary-to-learn-javascript-before-jquery/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="rank-math-link">Is It Necessary To Learn JavaScript In Order to Learn jQuery</a>.

**here is a takeaway from all of this:**

- Understanding the core principles of the web, you more are likely going to hit a wall due to the evolution of web languages and the invention of new frameworks.
- If you understand the core fundamentals of JS will make you able to solve complex problems.
- Your productivity is going to go up on the front-end as well as the back-end.
- You'll know how exactly are browsers and computers work.

## what to learn before getting deeper into javascript

There are certain topics, which must be learned before, learning the basic, concepts, of “JavaScript”:

if you're planning to get good at Javascript and learn the advanced stuff which is a good thing to do, you have to focus on these concepts which are basic but very important.

- ***Control Flow***<br>1.1. if<br>1.2. else<br>1.3 advanced-conditional<br>1.4. switch-for
- ***Handling Errors***<br> you can start with those two basic commands, which are used for handling errors using the console, ***`console.log`***, and ***`console.error`*** respectively.
- ***Data Models***<br>The data has to be specified, it has to be kept separate or in chunks. though, and designed in that way. It also functions the various types of ***Parameters, objects, and variables,*** etc.
- **Asynchronicity**<br>**Promises** and **Async Await** are used for asynchronous tasks in your web app, To avoid such type of errors, the ***Promises*** or ***Async await*** is used in the apps.
- ***Node.js***<br>automation is what you're going to need down the road when the work you're trying to do is getting heavier and heavier, So, using Javascript, to automate is needed.

## takeaway

a recap of the answer would be, you have to understand some of the web basics such as TCP/IP and HTTP protocol and the secure version of it HTTPS. and it's always good to take a look at how browser engines work and how servers communicate and how the web page is served to you from a server to your machine that displays it on your browser.

other things are cookies, sessions, local storage, you'll need to understand what those are and how they're implemented by the browser so that you try to use them in your Javascript code you don't face a really hard time understanding them and using them at the same time.

remember that Javascript is a way to interact with HTML tags that you create and also the styles you give it with CSS, so it's really important to fully understand those languages in order to not get stuck when learning how to interact with the DOM using Javascript.

let me list those things for you so you don't have to read through all of those paragraphs if you're in a hurry.

- **Web Fundamentals**<br>1.1 **HTTP/HTTPS**<br>1.2 **TCP/IP**<br>1.3 **How Servers Communicate**<br>1.4 **Cookies, Sessions, Local Storage**
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
