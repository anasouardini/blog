JavaScript, developed by Brendan Eich, is a scripting language that works within HTML pages. However, most people tend to wonder why JavaScript is considered a scripting language when it differs greatly from Java. Understand that Java is an existing programming language that handles its task quite differently from JavaScript.

Originally, JavaScript was referred to as Live Script during the development stage. But since Java had become incredibly popular, Brendan Eich changed the name to JavaScript. Although this move was purely done for marketing reasons, JavaScript is still viewed as a scripting language.

**JavaScript is not a programming language in the strict sense. Instead, it is a scripting language because it uses the browser to do the dirty work. If you command an image to be replaced by another one, JavaScript tells the browser to go do it. Let us take a comprehensive look at everything about JavaScript that makes it a scripting language.**

**scripting language is a language that tells the host the series of actions that need to be done. in the same manner JavaScript instructs the browser to carry out those series of actions, it tells the browser what to do, when to do and how to do a certain action.**

the same thing is happening with a shell script like Python and PHP, or any other scripting language.

## Understanding the Differences Between Programming and Scripting

First, understand that all scripting languages constitute programming languages. In theory, however, the theoretical is in the fact that scripting languages do not need a compilation step. For example, a C program will need compiling before you can run it. A scripting language, on the other hand, does not need to be complied.

You will soon find out that complied programs tend to run smoother and faster than the interpreted programs. Note that the compiled programs are first converted code for the native machine. Compilers will also read and analyze any line of code only ones, and report all the errors in the system collectively. The interpreter can analyze the code statements every time it stops at that instance.

In reality, the difference between scripting and programming is getting blurred with changes in technology. There have been great improvements in computation capabilities of advanced coding practices and modern hardware over the past years.

When deciding whether a language falls under a programming language or scripting language, you also have to look at the environment of execution. Understand that you can design a C language interpreter and use it as a scripting language. At the same time, you can also create a compiler for JavaScript and apply it in a non-scripting manner. Examples include the JavaScript engine used in Goggle Chrome which complies with the regular JavaScript code into machine code, instead of interpreting.

Are you curious to know some of the traditionally used scripting languages that don’t need a compilation step? Well, for starters we have JavaScript, PHP, Python, and VBScript. The common programming languages that are used with explicit compilation steps include C and C++.

## Advantages of Scripting Languages

### Easy learning

You don’t need to be an expert in web technology to learn scripting languages. Understand that most of these scripting languages are usually taught in college. Learners get to understand everything about the workings of these scripting languages during computer management courses and PC networking.

Let’s say a network administrator needs to automate a repetitive task, a scripting language will be the first thing that comes to mind. It is. Therefore, worth assuming that most network administrators will have no problem handling scripting languages.

here is an article where i talk just about how easy it is to learn JavaScript:

### Scripting is Free

Once you have a few people within your organization that can create a script, you won’t need to hire a consultant or purchase any software, to begin with. Within a few hours, you could have a fully running script that can handle some of the routine tasks in the organization.

Understand that hiring a consultant and purchasing software can be rather expensive. You will need to spend more money than you already anticipated. Scripting will allow you to perform most of the routine and time-consuming tasks with zero investments.

### Fast Editing

As discussed in this article, scripting languages have limited data variables and structures. What this means is that you can quickly edit the data, thus improving efficiency. Programming languages aren’t so easy to edit or make improvements.

Understand that improving efficiency is the first step towards ensuring that your organization is running effectively. You will have no downtime and quick operations when using scripting languages. You can also make changes whenever you see necessary.

### Operating Systems come with a Free Built-in Scheduler

Understand that scripts can be directly scheduled through the Windows operating system or UNIX system scheduler. Since the built-in scheduler is already free, you can work with any scripting language without a glitch.

However, PowerShell and JavaScript are considered as among the most advanced scripting languages. This is because Microsoft already features built-in functions that work with device management, active directory, and software installation.

### Interactivity and Functionality

Scripting languages, including JavaScript, helps in adding visualization combinations and interfaces in web pages. Did you know that modern web pages need the use of scripting languages? You can only create fascinating and enhanced web pages using scripting languages.

When you look around, you will notice that different libraries form part of different scripting languages. These libraries come in handy when creating new applications in different web browsers. Understand that you create applications that are distinctly different from normal programming languages.

## Applications of Scripting Languages

Scripting languages are used in so many different areas. Below is a quick look at the most common applications of scripting languages such as JavaScript:

- Scripting languages get used in web applications. Understand that they are used on both the client and server-side. The server-side languages include PHP, JavaScript, and Perl, while the client-side include AJAX, JavaScript, and jQuery.

- Scripting languages are applied in system administration. Commonly used languages for this function include Python, Perl, and Shell scripts.

- They are used in multimedia and game applications.

- Used to generate and create plugins and extensions for applications.

and this is one of the reasons why JavaScript is so powerful and popular, and i wrote an article about all the reasons behind JavaScript's popularity and power:

## Conclusion

i hope this was a good answer to why is JavaScript is called a scripting language, and what it means when a language is a scripting language in the first place.

JavaScript is a scripting language that opens up a lot of possibilities and solutions. However, note that it can pose a security issue every once in a while. Ensure that all your systems are well protected to help you reduce the security threat. The applications of JavaScript and other scripting languages are too many for the language to be overlooked.
