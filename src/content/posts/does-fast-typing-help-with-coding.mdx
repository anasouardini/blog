in this article, I'm going to talk about a popular misconception that a lot of developers are falling into, which is that typing faster means coding faster, and I'll tell you in detail why is that not always the case.

some developers that are very experienced in the field and very talented are even in the top half when it comes to typing skills, but those are rare exceptions. the point is that it's very possible to not be very skilled at typing to be good at programming, with that in mind the majority of the best developers are good at typing fast but it doesn't necessarily mean that they have spent a lot of time practicing touch-typing, it comes very naturally since whenever you're practicing coding you're practicing typing os the more you code the more you become a good developer the more you can type faster to a certain degree. and that in my opinion is the correlation between typing faster and being a good programmer.

a question I get more often is “I’m a beginner at coding and I’m really slow at writing code, how can I learn to type faster so I can code faster?" **so does fast typing help in your coding skills?**

**fast typing which is called touch-typing can help you in coding that's for sure, but if you think that when you're going to learn how to touch-type you're going to be able to code faster you're wrong because fast typing is not fast coding since coding requires more thinking than coding. even if you're doing something that doesn't need that much thinking it would be some snippet for it so that you can copy past and do it even faster. also, fast typing is a skill that you'll learn as time goes and you don't need to use some app or website to help you with that, while you can spend that time learning new coding skills or practicing. another thing is that it's common to see programmers who don't type fast at all but they can get the job done and they can get hired at a lot of companies.**

**Fast touch-typing helps with coding, not because you can bang out the code faster, but because banging out the code is less of a distraction and less looking at the keyboard.**

so it goes without saying that being able to touch-type doesn't mean that you can be a good developer. the most people who can type faster are people who're working in jobs like administrative assistance or copywriters, they could write with a rate of 120+ words per minute (wpm), and with very little mistakes from time to time. sometimes typing without making too many mistakes may be better than writing faster with lots of mistakes.

we all know that typing fast is part of your job if you're a software developer, but there are bigger factors such as understanding what your clients are trying to achieve with their project and learning skills that help you code faster and writing maintainable and scalable code. so it's better to spend time on the bigger factors than on small factors such as typing faster.

typing slow doesn't hurt, unless you peck every each time you want to press a key then you should get that fixed.

as a beginner you might think, how come typing fast is not important in programming while all we do is typing all day long, well your job as a programmer is not typing fast but solving problems and that's taking more thinking than typing.

## what's the exact typing speed you need as a programmer

statistics tells you that the average typing speed is approximately 40 word per minute (wpm).

if you think that's you, then that's enough for you as a programmer, you can spend a lot of time typing fast but the benefits you get are slightly better at programming since you can type your solution faster and probably more accurately (fewer mistakes), but this is as I said is a minor factor, while you can spend that time on practicing on your skills.

with that being said, if you're on the other hand a very slow typer or what we call it single finger typing at approx 10 words per minute (wpm), then I highly suggest that you go practice on some website or download an app to help you out with that, it's also going to remove some of the frustrations and boost your productivity.

if you're still not sure about what speed is good enough and what speed is really bad, here are some ranges and what you can expect from them:

- **0-20:** Basically people will assume you are incompetent and you'll struggle a lot while coding.
- **20-30:** you might be more skilled than others and you think faster than them but with this speed, you'll come across as a slower programmer since you'll struggle or you look like you're thinking a lot.
- **30-45:** this is what you want to be if you're below this rate, it's normal, it doesn't make faster but you're not going to be slow at the same time, so it doesn't make much difference at the race.
- **45-65:** you'll look like the guy that's good with computers even if you aren't since you'll seem very quick it might add some speed in coding but not much. so if you're just below this rate you don't have to go for this speed.
- **65-100:** if you ever heard of what's a bottleneck, this is what typing is going to be for you when you're at this level of touch-typing, so typing isn't a problem for you anymore.

it's like computer components, if your typing is a bottleneck then it doesn't matter at all since you reached the max speed at touch-typing, but if it's not then it does matter (but you might not need to change it, depends on your speed).

## why touch-typing is important

I don't want you to dish fast typing altogether, but there are some reasons that can make you go for learning touch-typing using some app instead of learning it naturally while coding.

### you'll have time for the important things if your typing is efficient

since the most important thing about programming is thinking of the solution, a fast typist is going to have an advantage over slower typists since he's going to have more time to think about the solution while the slower typist still typing. writing tests, documenting for app users, writing e-mail messages, and many tasks like this, most of them are going to have more time dedicated to them because developers can type more quickly. 

### efficient typing helps in perceived faster typing

many of the best developers have some interesting characteristics and one of their characteristics is the ability to take advantage of all the different keystrokes, macros, and other devices to get the same task done more quickly. so not only the speed of typing what matters in order to do things faster but also learning IDE shortcuts, browser shortcuts, and OS shortcuts, and using other tools and devices that reduces the number of keys you're going to press to open a terminal for example.

if the idea isn't clear enough here is an example of a web server that refreshes the browser each time you hist Ctr+S, so it saves you the time of refreshing the page every time you wrote a line of code.

even if you're still a beginner and you're just working with small projects, it could still be very efficient to use these tools. you don't need to use the exact same tools that professional developers use you might not need it at all, just use the tools that are necessary for you but you have to be very good at. a faster developer might be very fast using sublime text and not good when using something like Atom or VScode may faster than developed who're using these Code Editors since he's very familiar with sublime text.

### Fast Typing is an Advantage when it comes to Software Development

what I personally think according to what happened to me is that fast typing naturally learned or you can call it a consequence of years of practicing writing code, it's obvious that some parts of the software development field are prone to benefit from touch-typing. so it's a big advantage for a fast typist to get his ideas out and convert them into code faster than other coders, but there are some ways like the one I mentioned above which is using tools like an IDE that helps with autocompletion, and these tools can give you the same advantage as if you're typing faster in most cases.

### it improves your accuracy

the accuracy is how much mistakes you make while typing, many times you come across some Javascript error that seems very hard to solve but when you copy the syntax from a form online that talks about the same property that you're using you'll find that it's working, then you compare your code with the other one to find out that it's just a typo that you wasted 5-10 minutes looking for the solution.

and your typing accuracy is gained by your ability to remember each key on your keyboard, and this going to improve when you use the correct way of using the keyboard, it all depends on the way you place your hands on the keyboard, and also whether you change the keyboard that you're using, because not all keyboards have the same layout of keys, so you have to stick to one keyboard or if you have to change it try to change it with something that looks like it.

one thing about choosing a keyboard if you're serious about your typing skills is to choose a keyboard that has a standard way of placing keys so that if you had to change it you'll find the same layout keyboard with many themes to choose from.

having accuracy in typing is more important than typing faster, less mistakes with an average speed is better than faster typing with a lot of mistakes, so I highly advise you to learn how to place your hands over the keyboards before you try to type faster.

### it makes your typing more efficient

when I first started blogging I was I often forget about the paragraph that I'm trying to write several times before finishing it, and that's because when I start typing the idea in my mind I always forget the rest of it while typing the first part due to my slow typing. but now I almost think as I write which saved a lot of time and effort.

but that's me as a blogger, since blogging needs more speed in typing than coding, it's not just an opinion I also was a web developer that makes websites for clients on Fiverr one time.

another thing is that typos in blogging are easy to find and fix but in code, it's very hard and you have read your whole code carefully in order to find that it's `function` instead of writing `function`

and you can't have a hint about the typo you make, for example when you type a command on CMD or on Linux Terminal when you hit Enter/return the terminal is not going to tell you that might wrote `dc` by mistake trying to write `cd` but instead, it shows you an "unknown command" message and that's all you have to work with to figure out what's the problem with your command.

improving accuracy is not going to eliminate all these errors at once but it's going to reduce those typos to a minimum number, so expect to face these types of errors from time to time even if you have good typing skills.

### it saves your neck

it's very common to see people who're slow typists keep moving their head back and forth from facing the screen to facing the keyboard which very natural since they don't have their keyboard's map in their brain, and this head movement can hurt your neck in the long run.

and less time looking at your keyboard means less time bending your head down and a better healthy neck.

**learn touch-typing and save your neck :D**.

## do you really need fast typing

as I said before, learning touch-typing could be less helpful than focusing on practicing your coding skills or building some projects to add to your portfolio, but it might be the skill that you need to learn to boost your productivity or to help you get off the ground if your speed at typing is really bad.

**here are two factors that could help you decide on which way is better for you:**

### 1. Typing speed is not coding speed

I keep mentioning this point because it's very important to remember that typing is not coding. especially with nowadays tools such as IDEs which help you do less coding and spend more time on thinking.

some features are reducing the effort you make to 40% by auto-completion and error correction while typing, basically, all the features that are not beginner-friendly which ruins your learning if you're a beginner, especially snippets feature which can automatically type a whole javascript or HTML component altogether by simply typing a shortcut for it which can be just two or three letters then pressing `TAB`,  and there you go, who needs fast typing anymore.

another feature is when editing a word or a tag or adding text to many `<p>` tags at once, then there is a hotkey for that, `Cmd + D` which is going to help you select every `<p>` tag that exists in your file, then you can do pretty much anything and it's going to be done for all of those selected tags like inserting text or adding an attribute.

here is an example of writing an HTML login form, you'll get the full idea when watching this video:

after you watch this video you'll find that the most important factor to focus on is understanding what all those tags do and what all their attributes for. so typing fast looks like it's a very small factor.

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDRnKW1qbzA&feature=youtu.be

</div></figure>

but keep in mind that you can do this with one shortcut if it's a thing that you always do in your projects if your work is building websites for some clients as a routine.

### 2. Programming involves thinking more than writing code

while you're coding almost all the time you're going to be dealing with bugs and figuring out how to fix them and finding the best way of coding the solution, your brain is constantly thinking what to do next and whether this solution is ok or not and you'll spend much time going back and forth between your code editor and your browser for example. so whether you're a very fast typist or not, these facts are not going to change anyway.

and as I mentioned earlier you'll spend much more time thinking instead of writing. if I would display this in math it would be 7/10 of the time is spent on thinking, so what's the difference if you could hammer the keyboard and go crazy with your fingers 3/10 of the time then stop to think and debug in the browser.

## reasons why touch-typing might be helpful to learn

don't get me wrong, when I say fast typing is not fast coding it doesn't mean that you should forget about fast typing, but it just means that it's not that important and you shouldn't focus on it too much.

fast typing still matters, but just don't think of it the way Hollywood wants you to think.

if you want to be a good programmer it should be easy for you to type using all your fingers, if you're using one finger to type then it's going to be a big deal for you.

while I was doing some research to find more information and also to confirm what I got, I came across this answer which I found really awesome, I highly recommend you read it:

> touch-typing is not important in and of itself: it's crucial to be able to type without disturbing your train of thought. That’s a mandatory skill for programmers. after all, is all about thinking; the lines of code you’re writing are just an imperfect interface between your thoughts and the machine. It's better to do things that can make the thinking process easier.

it's an advantage to be able to type fast, you can call it a graph of a diminishing return. almost 80% of the improvement is coming from being able to type without thinking hard or spending more time fixing your typos, and about 20% is coming from your ability to type fast and accurately.

**if you want to test your speed at typing you can check out this website called <a aria-label="typing speed test (opens in a new tab)" href="http://typing-speed-test.aoeu.eu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="rank-math-link">typing speed test</a>, but don't consider it as a disqualification or validation of improving at programming.**

## Jobs that require typing skills (touch-typing)

if you think that only programmers are known by fast typing, and you really have to learn that in order to become a programmer, then you're wrong. now you might be asking then who are other people that really need to be able to type faster? here are some jobs that require touch-typing as a necessary skill in order for you to get hired.

- **Data Entry**<br>each day more and more services are going online, and companies and startups need to implement databases in their project, and data entry means inserting random information in database tables, it involves inserting data which can contain some first names and last names, and it really needs you to be very accurate and fast at the same time, this might seem fast but no error should be inserted in the database.<br> 
- **Freelance TranscriptionTechnology**<br>the need for transcription experts still not made obsolete, they still needed to create a typed log for spoken text. most songs and videos online require some accompanying text in order for their content to be searchable by web bots like google bots, in this kind of job, the more text you layout the more time you gain to do another one the more you can charge for your service.<br> 
- **Assistant and Secretarial Work**<br>dictation and hand-written notes used to be the norm for secretarial work and assistance, the requirements of today's job are more inline with calendars maintaining, running social media accounts, answering emails. fast typing skills can really help you when writing those timely and professional emails in the face of an overflowing company inbox. so it's a must unless you're not planning to complete the rest of your duties.<br> 
- **Journalism and Content-Creation**<br>when we're talking about news or content online, they really need to draft stories and scripts for their videos as fast as possible and with no mistakes, and this is when touch-typing comes to play. bloggers like me and other content creators like YouTubers also have to have this skill or they have to pay someone else to do it. so for these kinds of jobs where the writing is the main focus, touch-typing is definitely the skill to be needed after copy-writing.<br> 
- **Copy-editing**<br>after a writer has done his part of writing ideas and information about a certain topic, the editor comes to edit all this text looking for grammar mistakes and formatting text in a readable way for the user, and the client always wants to publish his article ASAP, so if you keep looking at your keyboard each 5-10 letters you're just not quite there, time is money for you as an editor and for him as a blogger.

## how to actually learn fast typing

it's not a complicated thing at all, but needs a lot of practice, here are the steps o learning touch-typing:

- Learn how to handle the keyboard. How to hold your hands, what fingers are covering what keys, etc.
- Practice, over and over.
- stick to one keyboard

### learn how to use the keyboard

you may have to curve your hands and fingers a little so you can cover the ASDF and JKL; keys which are in the middle row of the keyboard. in touch-typing, they call them HOME  ROW since you start from them and you return to them all the time.

F and J keys which your index fingers cover, have a raised line on them so that you can find them without looking.

you can find more on this <a aria-label="page (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.ratatype.com/learn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="rank-math-link">page</a> on ratatype website.

### practice over and over: We Do Well What We Do Often

being able to type fast does not mean that you're a better developer but it can be evidence on the many hours you spent learning and practicing since when you learn the touch-typing technique you still have a lot of practicing to do, and it's going to be pointless if you practiced on writing some random text instead of doing your own thing which is writing code and that's why being able to type faster can mean that you've spent a lot of time coding.

one thing that you might notice is that sometimes you type faster and sometimes you'll struggle, and that's because we do well what we do often, I bet that you can write your name and last name faster than other name and last name since you've done over and over, the things you do every day are the things that you can do faster.

how long should you practice and how often depends on how serious you are about getting faster at typing your code.

but generally 20 minutes a day if used properly, should really improve your typing skill within a week.

as I said it's better to practice on your code but if you find it hard at the beginning you can use a program or an online speed test to get you comfortable first.

### sticking to one keyboard might also be helpful

I didn't know this until I changed my keyboard, it was killing me at first since I was hard for me to adapt to the new keyboard, then I realized how much muscle memory you build using the same keyboard for a long time (years), so try to buy a standard keyboard so when you change it you can always find one with same design layout.

Muscle and shortcut memory certainly help, but I don't know how important a skill it is. But it's definitely something you build over time.

**i also recommend you try to pick up one of these two keyboards that are very good for touch-typing:**

**Membrane Keyboards:**

- Logitech K845 Mechanical Illuminated Keyboard, Mechanical Switches <a href="https://amzn.to/3hRYbTq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">check it on Amazon</a> (Affiliate Link)

## takeaway

it's not surprising to find expert developers typing faster, at least that's what found when working with other developers and they are generally fast typists, the correlation would be if you have a lot of years of coding you'll learn to type faster anyway, and the fact that you want to learn to touch-type is a side effect of trying to be more productive which is what makes you a good developer.

that's why more often best developers are fast typists.

the fast typing skill is what helps developers get more things done in the same amount of time. But as always and as with everything in life there always going to be some exceptions and especially with software development. there some good developers that are not even in the top half in terms of fast typing ability, but as I said those are exceptions since most expert developers are above average fast typists.

fast typing is not going to make a better programmer directly but it can make more productive so that you'll like it when you use the keyboard, with the productivity you'll eventually become better and better at programming, also when comparing yourself with other programmers that have the same level as you, you could have an edge over them since you can type the code faster.

**here is a video that can help you learn to type faster without doing too much effort, (not doing too much effort is the result of a lot of practicing at the beginning):**

I also was guilty of learning fast typing because I tough it helps to code faster, so if your plan was to learn to touch-type because you heard that it helps to code faster then I hope that you understand why developers are fast typists and how fast typing can affect your programming skills,
