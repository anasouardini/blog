Javascript is the next thing a developer thinks about learning when finishing HTML and CSS courses, but unlike those markup and styling languages, Javascript is really different when it comes to syntax. so itâ€™s a step forward and definitely is going to be harder. if you know some back-end languages you might say that it works the same as PHP or Python or whatever back-end language that you know,  it is using the same properties but the way it implements them is different. so, is Javascript language easy to learn?

**Javascript is easy to learn when it comes to the basics like variables and basic functions, but you'll find it very hard and confusing when you try to dig deep into it or master it, you'll face a hard time dealing with Callback functions, Asynchronous handling, Promises, Closures, etc.**

when deciding if a language is hard or easy for you to learn, you have to take into consideration a lot of factors such as if you know a language that is similar to it and things like that.

so the degree of Javascript difficulty relies on the knowledge that you have before you approach it, if the level of knowledge you bring to it is low it's going to take you a long time to adapt to it and that what makes it look hard to you.

for example, if you're learning javascript for the web, the knowledge that you should have would be HTML and CSS as well as learning a little bit about how the internet and browsers work (you can learn that in 1 hour).

those are the fundamentals, if you don't know any of them you're going to suffer when learning javascript and if you know some of them it'll a little bit easier.

## things that make Javascript easy to learn

as you might know by now the easiness of learning Javascript is relative, so you have to identify the things that make learning javascript easy or hard for you and know how to deal with them. let me tell you about some of the things that makes Javascript relatively easy for you.

as I said above, the knowledge you bring to it is really affecting your difficulty of learning Javascript so one of the things that make Javascript easy to learn is having solid knowledge before approaching it.

### learning only the basics

one of the things that could make javascript easy for you is if you want to **just learn the basics**, so basically you don't need all that advanced stuff like Closures and OOP which could be very hard to learn.

take your time and decide whether you need the advanced stuff like class and OOP, you might not use them at all if all that you're doing is building the front-end of a website.

those basics are the core basics and DOM manipulation basics, DOM manipulation also has easy and advanced parts but most of it is easy unless you want to do the really advanced manipulations which can be done easily by using a framework such as Vue or React.

### using jQuery

so if you're not concerned about being able to code some advanced scripts in Javascript you can just learn the basics of it or learn jQuery which is way easier from the syntax perspective and DOM manipulation.

the DOM manipulation could be really easy if you do it with jQuery instead of Javascript, since that what jQuery meant for in the first place. so you can learn some javascript basics then learn jQuery and you'll be fine with all the basic tasks.

don't get me wrong, jQuery can also be hard to learn if you want to master it, but if you just want to use it for DOM manipulation to make things easier for you it could be very efficient.

**NOTE:** if you're serious about learning Javascript and you want to be called a senior Javascript developer or land a job at a company or something like that, you really have to learn Javascript the hard way. matter of fact these easy tricks like using jQuery to make DOM manipulation easier are not going to help in the long run and maybe make it worst.

## things that could make javascript hard to learn

I said "could make" because you could be serious about javascript or you could be ok with just learning the basics, if you are then keep in mind that javascript is going to give you some hard time when you step up from the basics and try to learn the advanced stuff.

### approaching it with week knowledge

if you just learned the basics and you're thinking about jumping to some Javascript framework, or if you haven't started yet and thought about doing the same, prepare for a really difficult time understanding why all those errors are appearing.

also when learning the basics, if you don't know how the web works you might face some difficulties at the beginning of your journey, you might learn how the web works along with learning javascript but having that knowledge before getting into learning Javascript is going to be way better.

whenever you want to learn a language or a framework it's better to take a look at the basics that help you understand that language or framework better and ease up your learning. I wish that someone told me this when I just started.

### ES5/ES6 Syntax

you might find courses that use ES5 through all the courses which are fine for beginners since knowing ES5 is always good to understand the fundamentals and also helps you with learning ES6 in the future.

if you are just getting started and you don't know whether it's better to start with ES5 or ES as a beginner you can check out this article that I wrote that's covering this topic,  <a href="/posts/should-you-start-with-es6-or-es5/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="rank-math-link">Should I Start Learning JavaScript ES6 Or ES5 As a Beginner</a>?

but if want to read some books you'll find that almost all the books are using ES6 Syntax, so you really have to learn it if you want to progress.

another thing is the biggest change that happened to javascript is ES6, this version has a lot of things added to it and also the syntax has changed, so it's a big step, we write Javascript very differently now. I said before that a lot of books are using ES6 so you have to learn it there are also books that are highly rated and they don't use the updated Syntax ES6 so that might be a problem for some.

it might be helpful for you to take a course that teaches Javascript ES6 from the beginning. I recommend you go for this course <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="rank-math-link" href="https://youcanlearnhowtocode.com/which-is-the-best-online-javascript-bootcamp-for-you/" target="_blank">Javascript-Only Bootcamps</a>, it really good if you want to go for it, and you can always consider this course from Andrei Neagoie's <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="rank-math-link" href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=05QWBI3s3Nk&mid=39197&murl=https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/" target="_blank">The Complete Web Developer in 2019</a>, it also covers HTML and CSS if you would like to revise them.

### DOM Manipulation

you might start learning DOM manipulation and you write some lines and you think that it's an easy thing to learn, but once you get to the advanced stuff you'll find that it's one of the most difficult Javascript aspects to learn.

since a lot of people who are asking if javascript is easy to learn are just getting started let's talk about what the DOM is.

first of all, the DOM is not part of the specifications of Javascript language, but it's an API that is very necessary for front-end web development. the DOM is allowing you to create, remove, and edit the DOM elements which are the elements that you create with HTML.

that's why they call it DOM manipulation since you can manipulate these elements however you want according to what the user is doing on your web page, which makes the web experience much interactive.

web developers were facing a lot of challenges when DOM features were not implemented in the browser consistently. so they were writing different code for different browser in order for the web app or web page to work the same across all browsers.

the issue was solved by jQuery in 2006. and that's why a lot of developers are relying on it. but now we're don't with those problems there is no necessity to use jQuery for DOM manipulation.

if you're wondering whether to start with using jQuery or learn Javascript first check out my article about this, <a href="/posts/is-it-necessary-to-learn-javascript-before-jquery" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="rank-math-link">Is It Necessary To Learn JavaScript In Order to Learn jQuery</a>.

but since the DOM manipulation in vanilla Javascript is hard, jQuery might be good for you to learn, but if you want to work with a certain company you should consider whether it's hiring developers with jQuery or they want only senior Javascript developers

### Promises

let me explain a Javascript promise really quick, imagine that you're a father and your kids asked you to get him a new phone and you promised him that you'll get him a new phone the next month.

your kid doesn't know if he is going to get that phone or not in the next month. so there are two options, either you buy him a phone or not because you don't the money yet.

so the promise is that simple in the beginning, but it has 3 states:

- **Pending:** your kid doesn't know if he's going to get that phone
- **Fulfilled:** you have the money, you're going to buy him a phone
- **Rejected:** you don't have the money, you're not going to buy him a phone

Javascript Promises are a little bit hard to learn, but as you see it's easy to understand, but once you try to do some fancy stuff with it prepare for some errors that you can't explain why they popped up.

### Asynchronous handling

the first thing you'll be using is the synchronous programming model which is doing only one task at a time, so when a function is doing some long-running task, it only returns when the task has finished, so at this long time while the task is not finished you can't do anything else, so the next line has to wait.

this might be not good for your web app, and that's where the asynchronous programming model comes.

the asynchronous model allows for multiple tasks to be happening at the same time, the long-running tasks will continue running while other tasks are doing their thing until the long-running tasks finish and then the script gets informed and get the returning result (calculations, data from an API, etc).

that behavior of the asynchronous model is happening on its own function call stack, and this is why people find it to be hard to learn, so without promises, managing exceptions across asynchronous code is really hard. and since each callback starts with an empty stack, the `catch`Â handlers would not be on the stack when they throw an exception.

### Closures

closures sometimes don't make any sense for some developers and that's for a reason, oftentimes they are taught backward, average developers might know what a closure is but they might not know what they are useful in the first place, or why it's needed in your code.

they  are very difficult to grasp but once you learn them you'll notice a big difference in your progress in Javascript.

### classes and oop

when I was learning javascript, the most difficult thing that I faced a hard time understanding is OOP and classes, I knew what OOP means and also how to use it but I had no idea where and when should I use them.

so the hard part, when I was learning OOP, is the "why" part of it, but the mechanics of it were slightly simple, it was more like a solution in search of a problem to solve, here some reasons you might find OOP hard to learn:

- learning Object Orienting from the start is the first reason that leads to the lack of understanding of why it's there, so it's a bad idea. In some cases the procedural coding is not a "bad habit" and it might be the best way to learn something. before you learn procedural programming good enough for its limitations to become visible, the problem is this is what every course is teaching you.
- the thing that is going to help you grasp OOP is knowing the basics of data structures before learning OOP.
- if you ever heard of "seeing the forest through the trees", it's what design patterns are helping you with, when you learn them you'll start to see where implementing OOP is going to solve a huge problem and where it's not required. Furthermore, when you really understand OOP, most design patterns become obvious in hindsight.

## Comparing JavaScript to Other Programming Languages

if you have experience with some programming languages especially back-end languages like PHP and Python then your learning journey will be easier than if you don't know any other language at all. the first language you learn is always going to be harder than your second language since they have some common basics, and that really helps you with learning the second language.

don't get me wrong it's not that if you know a back-end language then Javascript variables and functions are fine to skip. no, it's not like that they all have variables and functions but they implement them differently so don't skip them but they will be easier to remember and understand in general.

### How Different Browsers Effect the JavaScript support

the problem with Javascript is that in browsers, every browser implements Javascript differently so that adds some extra work to make your code compatible with all browsers. other languages don't need this extra work for compatibility and that's what makes it a little bit harder to learn.

here are some examples for Javascript compatibility use the website <a href="http://caniuse.com" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="rank-math-link">can i use</a> which giving you a good idea about whether a feature of any web language is supported in all browsers or not.

## so is it easy to learn Javascript?

another thing that you should know is that it's not just you, there are lots of developers who are asking the same question, or else I would never go the idea of writing this article, and also professional web developers are avoiding Javascript assiduously to not get burnt out.

so I'm not going to tell you that Javascript is really hard or really easy, but it's not the easiest nor the hardest language in the world and it's really worth the trouble.

**Javascript is easy to learn when you just got started and you're trying to learn the basics, but some advanced concepts in Javascript are a little bit harder to learn and they could be very hard if you don't have a solid understanding of the basics, so in general, it's not the hardest language in the world but difficulties are always there like any other language.**

so it takes you months to get good at Javascript fundamentals is that considered as being easy to learn the language, one thing to keep in mind that Javascript is absolutely not the hardest language out there but everyone faces some difficulties in learning Javascript and the barriers are different for each one. I hope you get the point.

a lot of developers advise people who got started in learning Javascript to not resist that temptation to go too fast while learning the fundamentals of a  language regardless of your style of learning or your learning needs. you'll face a really bad time after you move up from a concept to concept too quickly without any revising or practice, you'll forget the simplest thing you've learned.

that means if you don't handle your basics very well and you don't have a solid understanding of Javascript fundamentals it'll be harder for you to pick up other concepts as you go forwards.

with this in mind, just keeping your learning sessions consistent is going to get you through it in a matter of months if you're putting in the time required. if you're not sure about how much time to put in every day check out my article about this, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" class="rank-math-link" href="/posts/are-2-hours-a-day-enough-to-learn-javascript/" target="_blank">Are 2 Hours a Day Enough to Learn Javascript</a>

## Takeaway

the most thing to remember is that Javascript is an interpreted language and that's why it's easier than most languages. that's what allows you to test your project before even finishing it, whenever you write few lines you'll see the result right away in the browser and that what helped me a lot when I was learning it.

and for a web page, even a small piece of Javascript code can do some good enhancements to your webpage. I find that very helpful for my productivity.
