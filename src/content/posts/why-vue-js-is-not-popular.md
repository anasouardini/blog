While coding languages are of full status on their own, frameworks have been associated with making developers’ work easier thanks to the provision of a smooth development basis. To complement the need for optimal frameworks, developers have had a variety of front-end frameworks for their pursuits with only a few remaining popular. According to Stack Overflow, while Vue.js has seen incredible growth and success in the previous years, the framework remains unpopular with only 15.2% using it.

This is quite low as compared to its fellow JavaScript frameworks React and Angular which boasts of 31% and 30% of use by developers. This article will highlight Vue.js as one of JavaScript’s top frameworks, explaining why the framework remains not famous in the world of custom software development.

**Vue js is not popular because it's a new framework compared to React js and Angular js, and it's not used by a lot of market leaders, another reason is it has very few resources compared to the popular frameworks.**

## What is Vue.js?

Vue refers to an open-source progressive framework engineered to build user interfaces and single-page applications. The framework is known to seamlessly power sophisticated single-page apps when coupled with both supporting libraries and modern tools. Created back in 2013 by Evan You, Vue js has seen the number of its users rise each day gradually.

However, despite a gradual rise in its market share, Vue js remains unpopular as compared to other JavaScript libraries and frameworks. Notable companies that use include Trustpilot, Alibaba, Euronews, Vice, and Behance.

## Reasons Why Vue.js is not Popular

Vue js is not bad at becoming popular as you see in this chart from google trends:

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/why-vue-js-is-not-popular-1-1024x549.png" alt="why-vue-js-is-not-popular" class="wp-image-492"/><figcaption><a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&geo=US&q=vue%20js" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&geo=US&q=vue%20js</a></figcaption></figure>

but after that it starts getting less searches in google.

but Vue js community is getting bigger and bigger, React has 100kb when it comes to community while vue js has 80 even though it's a new framework compared to react.

Despite Vue js becoming a fully-fledged framework containing developer tooling and a grownup ecosystem, the framework has still struggled to rise the ranks of popularity as compared to other frameworks like React and Angular. The following are some of the reasons why Vue.js is not famous.

## 1- The Library is Not Old Enough

With use over time, we expect that any great product has the ability to become popular since more people will be lining up for what the product has to offer. Borrowing from this philosophy, Vue remains quite unpopular as compared to other frameworks having the framework established just seven years ago. Some of the reputable and highly used frameworks have been in use for more than a decade.

Talking of time in use, ASP.NET might be one of the oldest frameworks still popularly used. According to Stack Overflow, ASP.NET boasts of use by at least 26.3% of developers. This Microsoft framework has achieved this thanks to its reliability and most especially popularity since 2002. In a similar way, jQuery, the most used framework by over 48.7% of developers was established in 2006.

However, this doesn’t offer a solid reason for Vue’s low popularity having React, which was established in the same year as Vue, used by over 31.3% of developers. This makes React the second most popular framework leaving Vue js seventh. On the other edge, Angular still has managed to please 30.7% of developers, and 32.4% of professional developers.

This leaves the ten years old Angular framework third overall and second most famous amongst professional developers as per a survey done by Stack Overflow. We might need to explore more reasons for Vue’s reduced popularity.

## 2- Language Barriers for English Developers using Vue.js

The greatest users of the framework Vue, remain to be the Chinese. With the Chinese Great Firewall making things quite different in the nation, some of the popular resources are not available. As a result, learning some JavaScript libraries and frameworks such as Angular and React becomes difficult. This has in a great way facilitated the popularity of Vue in China.

However, the larger image is what results from Vue being the preferable variant in the nation. Notably, the welcoming of Vue.js in China and Chinese speaking people has led to a significant part of its discussions and content come in the Chinese language. When searching for Vue js content, most of the instructions, forum discussions, and plugin descriptions are found in Chinese. With quite a large number of developers using English alone as their primary language, understanding the Vue framework remains in jeopardy hence many will indefinitely use other popular frameworks.

## 3- Vue is not Used by Lots of Market Leaders

One of the factors that lead to the popularity of a framework is its use not only by large masses of developers but by many market leaders. Notably, developers will benchmark from the market leaders since this indicates the latest and reliable trends when it comes to framework use. With just a few market leaders showing interest in the Vue framework, this has left the framework battle hard to attain popularity.

However, this is subject to change, especially with time. The adoption of Vue.js across large enterprises such as Alibaba and Xiaomi has helped popularize the framework. As a result, this has seen an increased demand for the framework in the labor market for developers. Notably, HackerRank reported steady growth in the users of the Vue framework.

## 4- Lack of Experienced Developers

As mentioned earlier, Vue is a relatively young technology just gaining traction over the years. According to Front-end Tools Survey in 2019, only 23% of developers would use the Vue framework at a comfortable level. This is quite low as compared to 48% of developers, double that of Vue js, who would use the React framework.

Additionally, a survey by HackerRank reported that about 33.2% of enterprises require expert developers to React while only 19% of the developers possessed the required skills. When it comes to Vue, the shortage in developers possessing the required abilities were a mere 5.1% against a 10% demand by companies for Vue developers.

Notably, mass adoption of the framework is yet to happen since there lack enough experienced Vue.js developers. To quench the thirst for Vue.js expert developers, a dedicated platform called VueJobs has been created for easy outsourcing. With time the number of developers proficient in Vue.js will increase hence offering the framework a chance to rise to stardom.

## 5- Limited Resources for Developing Using Vue.js

Even though Vue has a wide ecosystem with all the required tools for development, its ecosystem is not as large compared to other frameworks. Having a look at React, Angular, and Vue, you will realize that Vue has fewer plugins than its competitor frameworks. Notably, the difference in plugins is in hundreds, which is quite a lot.

Additionally, Vue supports not existing plugins that can be used with other frameworks. While this might only take some while to be fixed, this leaves Vue in jeopardy when it comes to its popularity.

**Other factors that have contributed to less popularity for Vue.js include:**

- A few learning resources with only Udemy offering Vue js lessons. Other frameworks like React has both Udemy and YouTube as the primary learning platforms for learning.<br>Reactivity complexity in Vue.
- Shifting from one framework to another is both time and money-consuming. Therefore, not many people might be willing to shift from the frameworks they are using for Vue.

However, when all is said, Vue remains one of the great frameworks for use by developers. The previous years have seen Vue become extremely popular amongst developers having it also gain support from Laravel.

## So, How Special is Vue.js

Vue.js might not be the most popular framework but it is promising to make a move for popularity thanks to its special features. The following are some features that make Vue special and a framework to watch.

### 1- Its Tiny Size

The size of a framework impacts largely the productivity of projects. Notably, the smaller the framework, the better it remains to be for projects. The downloadable zip with the Vue framework weighs a mere 18KB. Being a lightweight framework, Vue is lightning fast to download and install. Additionally, the framework impacts greatly your UX and SEO. Its small size also makes it one of the most convenient frameworks to develop small applications.

### 2- Vue’s Integration Capabilities and Flexibility

The ability to integrate with existing applications is one of the crucial trends for any emerging tech advancement. Notably, with Vue, it is quite easy, since the framework relies only on JavaScript having it require no other tools to function. On the catalog of Vue’s capabilities, you might need to note that the framework allows you to write the templates as per your preference. You will also notice that shifting to Vue from React or Angular won’t be much of a hassle with Vue’s internal organization being a mix of the two frameworks.

### 3- Vue is Easy to Learn

The only way a framework’s popularity will keep rising by over a hundred percent annually is the fact that it might be easy to learn. True to the word, you won’t require deep knowledge in TypeScript, libraries, and JSX to start coding with Vue. All you might require to know is basic JavaScript, HTML, and CSS knowledge to get started.

so it's very easy to learn Vue js if you're interested in it with some fundamentals of Javascript, here is an article that talk just about that, <a href="/posts/is-vue-js-easy-to-learn/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="rank-math-link">is Vue js easy to learn</a>.

## Takeaway
