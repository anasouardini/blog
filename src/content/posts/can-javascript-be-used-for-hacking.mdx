One question that has stirred a lot of debate in the past is whether or not JavaScript is safe and secure. Most people tend to ask whether JavaScript can be used for hacking. Well, for starters the simple answer is yes.

**Malicious code injections are one of the most deceitful** **ways that an individual can use JavaScript for hacking. Through cross-site scripting, referred to s XSS, a hacker can identify the vulnerability of your system and embed malicious JavaScript code into an authentic website. Note that the malicious code gets executed once the user visits the website.**

## Understanding JavaScript Libraries

Understand that a JavaScript library includes a prewritten library that lets you easily develop JavaScript-based applications. These libraries are especially important for most web-centric technologies including AJAX. The library contains functions that are used to accomplish useful tasks for your specific webpage.

Almost every website uses JavaScript libraries which means that you are always vulnerable to hacking. The most popular JavaScript library in a majority of these websites is jQuery.

**if you're wondering whether to learn jQuery before JavaScript or it's necessary to learn JavaScript first, check out this article:**

## How Can You Handle this Vulnerability?

As stated in the first section, JavaScript Libraries can be abused. There are, therefore, scenarios where someone can snoop around your online activity and violate both your security and privacy. The bad news is the fact that your website is vulnerable to these threats regardless of how secure you make it. Below are a few ways in which JavaScript can be used maliciously.

### Snooping What You Type

Attackers can use the JavaScript library vulnerability to track text boxes on the website. For example, think of the boxes that are used for status updates, writing comments, etc. in July 2012, researchers found out that it is possible to track content and keystrokes used by Facebook users. The data was collected from about 5 million Facebook users all over the world.

Understand that attackers only need a small amount of JavaScript code embedded in the website to record all your activity on a specific webpage. Notice that they will get to see everything you type, regardless of whether you search or not.

It can be quite scary to think about all the possibilities. Imagine someone taking note of every mouse movement, scrolling, and keystrokes. All this information will be tracked and recorded without your consent or knowledge.

### Tracking Browsing Habits

JavaScript hacking isn’t limited to keystrokes alone, but rather the browser cookies as well. Companies get to store all kinds of user data on browser cookies. You can then enjoy certain privileges such as personalized browsing and relevant ads.

Note that the cookies contain your browser type, location, preference, and so much more. A lot of websites track all these cookies to offer you a better browsing experience. If you think about it, the company follows you through every step whenever you visit their website.

Image all this information in the hands of an attacker. They get to see all your vulnerabilities and weak points which can be scary. In my opinion, cookies carry a lot of information that should never fall in the hands of the wrong person.

### Malicious Code Injection

As stated earlier, attackers use cross-site scripting to gather all sensitive user information. What is scary about using XSS is the fact that an attacker can extract financial data information. The malicious code is embedded into the website and can be used to steal all the information you input.

What’s even scarier is that XSS can be used to reproduce malware and viruses. Do you remember when Twitter was infected with a worm dubbed StalkDaily? It was rather unsettling to know that all your information was in the hands of an attacker to do with as they want.

Another vulnerability is referred to as cross-site request forgery (CSRF). It is a different kind of malicious JavaScript code that can be used to exploit a user’s browser, security permissions, and cookies. Understand that all this information can be used to perform actions on a different website.

BeEF, for example, is a project that uses a user’s browser vulnerabilities to get full control over a target computer system. It resembles Metasploit and uses hook.js to take control of an entire computer system.

## What is the Solution

Most people tend to think that disabling JavaScript is the best solution to avoiding the above attacks. However, understand that disabling JavaScript will shut you off from a lot of amazing web functionality. For example, you will lose the ‘infinite scrolling’ feature available on many social networks, blogs, and news sites.

Also, some browser exploits can still be accomplished even when you disable JavaScript. It is, therefore, not a great idea to disable JavaScript because it doesn’t completely protect you from attackers. You will only lose a lot of functionalities, which only makes your life miserable.

First, understand that there is no centralized information on JavaScript libraries including versions, known vulnerabilities, and release dates. It is, therefore, quite difficult to manage the vulnerabilities of the JavaScript libraries.

There is no reliable vulnerability database to help you better protect your system. you will, therefore, find it quite difficult to determine the versions of your library that are affected by any published vulnerability.

Attackers use JavaScript to steal data from a user’s browsing session, place fake content on webpages, and initiate transactions. Therefore, JavaScript should never introduce any attack vectors into their websites. This is the most viable solution to keep you safe when browsing the internet.

## Conclusions

Some libraries including Google Analytics and Google Maps do not publish any JavaScript version information. Fortunately, many libraries are hosted by their original creators which makes them much more secure. It means that every client automatically includes the latest versions that are updated to improve security.

Regular updates are the best way to keep you secured from JavaScript hackers. It will, therefore, help if you update your browser often to improve security and privacy. Understand that these updates also include bug fixes to improve user experience.
