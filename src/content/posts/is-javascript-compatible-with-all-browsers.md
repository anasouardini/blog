nowadays there are lots of technologies out there, but there is no technology that vilified as Javascript when it comes to cross-browser compatibility. I hear that a lot from other developers especially the advanced people in Javascript who are using the bleeding-edge features.

**Javascript is not compatible with all browsers but this only applies to the latest features of Javascript but the basic ones are supported almost on all browsers except for those browsers that don't care about supporting it anyway. so if you're just a beginner you have nothing to worry about since all features that you're going to be using are well supported in most browsers.**

there you have it, if that short answer is not enough bare with me so i can help you avoid those compabilities issues and methodologies to fix them.

Javascript is mainly built for browsers, there wouldn't be a Javascript without a browser engine, but each of these engines that browsers are built on top of them are different from each other, each one of them has its own way of implementing Javascript. the top popular browser engines are these three, Chrome uses the **V8** engine, Firefox uses **SspiderMonkey**, Microsoft edge use **Chakra.**

all the most used browsers are supporting Javascript the other browser such as text-based browsers like Lynx doesn't support Javascript but as I said it doesn't have a lot of users so don't have to worry about it. other than that the user himself can disable Javascript support in any browser.

so you have nothing to do if your site's visitors are using a text-based browser or disabling Javascript on their browser, the most important thing to do is to write a better Javascript code for compatibility. and also there are certain things that you can do to solve Javascript compatibility issues which I'm going to talk about right now.

## Common Cross-Browser JavaScript compatibility issues

after you know what browsers and behaviors can stop Javascript from working properly, let's take a look at mechanisms that solves these compatibilities issues.

### the use of Libraries

there are a lot of libraries out there some of them are native and others are third-party, some of them are not supported on all browsers, so the best practice here to check out the compatibility of a library before using it, you don't need to do the analysis as you might think you just need to check out some reviews on forums and youtube videos and you'll be fine, if no one is talking about it then don't bother doing the research just don't use at all.

another thing to check out in a library is if there is a community behind it that pushes updates frequently, the updates are very important if a library stops updating for a period of 6 months or so chances are it's going to be supported in some browsers since it's not keeping up with all the changes that happen in the web which is always changing.

### Using User Agents and Browser Sniffing

user-agent string exists in every browser, its function is to identify the browser name and version that the user uses to visit your web page or application. so you're wondering how do I get that string and deliver a compatible javascript code based on it on the fly. the method is called browser sniffing, and there is a code or doing that and you don't need to create your own. it helps you use this information in the user-agent string to tweak your UI/UX and Javascript functions to work on that specific browser.

here are user-agent strings of some of the common used browsers:

<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody><tr><td>**Browsers**</td><td>**Rules**</td><td>**Example**</td></tr><tr><td>Mozilla (Gecko, Firefox)</td><td>Mobile or Tablet token in the comment</td><td>Mozilla/5.0 (Android; Mobile; rv:13.0) Gecko/13.0 Firefox/13.0</td></tr><tr><td>Webkit-based (Android, Safari)</td><td>Mobile Safari token outside the comment</td><td>Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; U; Android 4.0.3; de-ch; HTC Sensation Build/IML74K) AppleWebkit/534.30 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0 Mobile Safari /534.30</td></tr><tr><td>Blink-based (Chromium, Google Chrome, Opera 15+)</td><td>Mobile Safari token outside the comment</td><td>Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; U; Android 4.4.2); Nexus 5 Build/KOT49H) AppleWebkit/537.36 (KHLM, like Gecko) Chrome/33.0.1750.117 Mobile Safari/537.36 OPR/20.0.1396.72047</td></tr><tr><td>Presto-based (Opera 12-)</td><td>Opera Mobi/xyz token in the comment (Opera 12-)</td><td>Opera/9.80 (Android 2.3.3; Linxu; Oera Mobi/ADR-1111101157; U; es-ES) Presto/2.9.201 Version/11.50</td></tr><tr><td>Internet Explorer</td><td>IEMobile/xyz token in the comment</td><td>mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; MSIE 9.0;Windows Phone OS 7.5; Trit/5.0; IEMobe/9.0)</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Browser_detection_using_the_user_agent" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="rank-math-link">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Browser_detection_using_the_user_agent</a></figcaption></figure>

so how web developers implement this in code, simply by using this property, **navigator.userAgent.indexOf(user-agent)**, user-agent is the user-agent string that we pass here as a parameter. I know it's not clear yet but let me show you an example of the code that implements this property.

```js
/* Firefox */
if(navigator.userAgent.indexOf("Firefox") !== -1){
        /*-----------------------------------------------------*/
       /*   The alternative code that works in this browser   */
      /*-----------------------------------------------------*/
}
```

## ways to solve Javascript compatibility problems

cross-browser testing is a little bit annoying I guarantee you that, but it's a very necessary step that you can't afford to get wrong. you can spend weeks on a project that you're happy with and you want to see how users are interacting with it but if you don't do the cross-browser testing nobody can see that.

so that one little mistake in your cross-browser testing could stop half of your clients from getting access to the website interface that uses the latest design the fancy carousals and the latest UI/UX tricks. so it's very important to solve all compatibilities problems that you have on your site.

I have here some steps for you to do on your site to make sure that you don't lose your audience, so here are the 10 things that you should check out to make sure that your site is working properly on most browsers.

### 01. Validate your code

their online services out there verify your code and tells you if it is valid or not, one of these services is <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="rank-math-link">W3C Markup Validation Service</a>, I highly recommend you use this service to make sure that your code is standard-compliant.

if you skip this process is more likely to notice some weird things happening on your site when you visit it from a browser and it doesn't when you do that from another browser. so it's better to keep your code consistent on all browsers.

if you're wondering, the service is checking your code against the standard markup and tells you what is complying and what is not in your code.

### 02. Fail gracefully

 keep in mind that whenever you add some feature is going to affect the compatibility of your website in some way or another. so to be prepared for this you to see how your website looks without Javascript and try to make look better if possible so that when your website fails to be compatible after an update in some browser it's going to look the best way it could or at least people can use it even though it doesn't look pretty.

### 03. Know your audience

when you start a project you have to think of the kind of users that could be using your phone, are they mostly going to use phones or are they from a certain country and what is the most used browser in that country, or is it for a company and what browser that company uses, etc. 

### 04. Consider using a framework

frameworks are helping with a lot of things and most of the things I didn't know when I was using them, and this is the case with most beginner and intermediate developers, and one of the things that frameworks take care of without you knowing is the compatibility of your code, not only a Javascript framework but also CSS libraries can help with your CSS code compatibility if you don't know that.

and whenever there is an update the library/framework also updates to keep up with the changes, and also they could take care of some compatibility issue that you would never know about until it fires.

### 05. Keep your design simple

by simple, I don't mean boring and old style, but try to reduce the number of libraries and plugins as well as implementing those cutting-edge properties in CSS or Javascript. the less you do that on your website the easier for you to maintain your code and fix those issues and the less you face difficulty making your code compatible.

### 06. Reuse and reduce components

this can help you with the ease of managing your code and an easily manageable code always has fewer errors and easier to maintain. and that certainly helps with keeping it with compatibility issues. the way it works is by reusing your other similar components that do almost the same job so that you're not going to type them with some typos.

and reducing those components can help you by reducing the places that you're going to check whenever you have an error you have to fix. this is not only is going to help you with the compatibility but also with maintaining your code in the long run and this also what differentiate a beginner developer from an experienced one.

### 07. Test with the difficult browsers first

this tip could save you a lot of time since if you don't start with the hardest one you might discover it later after getting 90% of the problem solved and it could interfere with what you've edited in your code earlier and you might need to rewrite your code again.

it might not be the case though, if so, you probably need to start with the popular one.

### 08. Create test scripts

the 8th tip is to test your sites using scripts even if your site is simple you should have a script that is expected to run in each browser, that's whether you're automating your tests or not those are necessary so that you don't miss thing up between runs.

### 09. Test as you go along

this should be obvious since if you don't test after every time you make some changes on your site you're going to find out that you have to change a lot of things which makes your testing harder. but don't get me wrong even if those changes were a lot, if they are very simple you don't have to do that unless you're automating it's going to be better to check since it's going to be easy. but generally, if the changes are complicated or include new properties it's better to check how compatible your website with browsers.

### 10. Check your features

I know I'm repeating myself self but I want to include it as a step so that it's rememberable. anyway, the thing is whenever you want to use a bleeding-edge feature you have to test its compatibility with all targeted browsers before even using it which easier than you think since you just have to write its name on <a href="https://caniuse.com/" class="rank-math-link">CanIUse</a> website and it's going to tell you about all the browsers and their version that support that particular feature.

## JavaScript Frameworks for Overcoming Cross-Browser Compatibility Issues

it is a normal thing that you'll have cross-browser compatibility issues no matter what size and complexity unless you're a robot that checks compatibility after each line of code added, that is a fact. but if your way of using Javascript is not proper you'll definitely have more of those issues but don't let that make give up on Javascript.

as I mentioned above when using frameworks really facilitate the development of cross-browser compatible web apps/websites, and here are some of those frameworks:

- <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="rank-math-link">React.js</a>
- <a href="https://angular.io/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="rank-math-link">Angular</a>
- <a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="rank-math-link">Vue.js</a>
- <a href="https://ionicframework.com/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="rank-math-link">Ionic</a>
- <a href="https://www.emberjs.com/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="rank-math-link">Ember.js</a>

## takeaway

so as you might know by now, you'll always find issues with compatibility on your project whatever you do, but there are some best practices that if you follow it's going to be less painful to solve those issues. also Javascript is the most language that faces cross-browser compatibility issues but if you are a beginner i advise you to not worry about this and keep learning as you won't face these problems as much as well as you're not required to make the best compatible web site on  the web.

so don't put too much pressure on your self and just keep learning and keep yourself motivated. if you're a beginner the best takeaway for you is that everything problem has it's own solutions and if doesn't then it's not a problem.

and if you are an advanced developer and you want to fix issues that hearts your website compatibility in browsers i highly advise you to get into testing which is a huge topic that you'll find courses on youtube just about testing. and to make this article very short here is a list of those things that i mentioned above:
