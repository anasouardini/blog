The first question that most people ask about JavaScript is whether or not it has classes. For starters, classes are small bits of code encompassing methods and multiple objects. They allow manipulation of the members’ functions and variables. Every programming language will have classes with different syntax, and JavaScript is no exception.

**In JavaScript, there are no classes in the class-based OOP sense of the word. JavaScript works with objects. If you want to encapsulate a few functions and properties together, you would create an object containing functions and properties, and not a class.**

## Understanding a Class

First, let's make it clear that a class itself doesn’t offer data. The ‘Object’ will contain all the data you need. As stated earlier, the class is the blueprint thus making the object the actual house. An instance will then contain individual data that is specific to that instance. You can’t sleep in your neighbor’s house because you built your home with the same blueprint.

Understanding the difference between classes and instances, therefore, becomes a huge problem. This brings us to the workings of OOP. Note that with JavaScript, you don’t need classes to be object-oriented. There is a way that you can handle OOP without having any classes.

With JavaScript, objects are the key factor and not the classes. Which gives you a style of OPP where there is no distinction between objects and classes. Referred to as prototype-based programming (PBP), it makes everything simple since every object can be an individual.

In PBP, you have all the data and methods contained at the same time. You can then add new methods and properties to your object whenever you want. The good news is that you get to make adjustments even when the program is running.

Although it sounds rather challenging, it is quite simple to learn and apply. Most programmers prefer the PBP language in JavaScript because it gives you a lot of manipulation room. It is also much faster to complete projects when you get a hang of it.

With JavaScript, there are no defined classes if you look at it from the perspective of class-based OOP. All you need to work with when using JavaScript is objects. If you are thinking of combining a few properties and functions, you would simply create an object that contains everything you need.

## What Happens to Inheritance

You will quickly come to learn that the fundamental property of a class the fact that it can inherit properties and methods from other classes. Two or more classes can inherit from other classes to ensure that no code is duplicated.

However, it is not set in stone that classes are specially designed for inheritance. In PBP inheritance is entirely done by the objects since you don’t need classes. Earlier on, we stated that an object in PBP contains all its properties and methods, including the actual state. This means that you can only inherit all those attributes by referencing or copying all the properties and methods of that object. This is what PBP was designed for, and thus the name prototypical inheritance.

For example, let’s say we wanted to make a ‘Lion’ object have access to the same properties and objects as ‘animal’. PBP allows you to simply make ‘Lion’ contain ‘animal’ since all the properties and methods are inside ‘animal’.

The great news is that JavaScript will call automatically support functions on the prototype. This means that it will search the prototype for a function that doesn’t exist on the object. Also, note that the prototype may also contain a different prototype within it. JavaScript will, therefore, search all the way up and down until you get the function you need.

The reason we refer to them as a prototype is because they are much more concrete as opposed to the class. With prototypes, you get a working thing that is more concrete than the class since it's more than just a blueprint.

You can always use your prototype to build a bunch of other copies that you can use. If you wouldn’t mind then you can sell your prototype to millions of customers. However, you must ensure that it is an exceptional piece of work to make it sell.

Think of it this way: if the ‘animal’ object is your prototype, then you can treat it like any other object. However, you can always use it to create new concrete creatures such as a ‘Zebra’.

## Is It Better than Classes?

A lot of experts will tell you that PBP is simpler and more straightforward than the class-based OPP. You get to work with fewer moving parts, thus making the work more transparent. Most programmers love using PBP because you can see how it works and make changes where necessary.

The greatest advantage of PBP is its flexibility. Understand that you can find it almost impossible to fix a class once you discover a problem. With classes, you have to create everything perfectly to start using the objects. This means that you need to include all the properties and methods that you will need before you start creating a class.

With PBP: js, you can start creating objects immediately and make changes where necessary. You get to quickly adapt your objects without having to pay a hefty price. Users, therefore, can comply with the ever-changing requirements of language programming.

However, the easy and quick change includes a huge risk: correctness. With classes, you can make a solid foundation with no mistakes. Just like blueprints, classes need to be designed with a lot of caution and accuracy. Making sure your codebase is correct and solid can be a huge challenge when working with PBP JavaScript.

## Conclusion

Although PBP is easy and comfortable to use, class-based OPP is more sturdy and rigid. However, the choice comes down to your preference and level of expertise. With class-based OPP you will have fewer bugs in your system when compared to PBP. The good news is that you get the option of choosing a suitable solution depending on your current problem.
