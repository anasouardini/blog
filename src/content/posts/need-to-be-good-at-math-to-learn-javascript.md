One of the greatest concerns among a majority of people is whether or not you need to be good at math to learn JavaScript. However, experts will tell you that you can learn JavaScript effectively and quickly with a basic understanding of math.

**Any math that is used in JavaScript will most often be addition and subtraction. In any case, you will quickly learn that JavaScript comes with impressive math functions that make logarithms, rounding, and trigonometry easy. All you need is a basic understanding of algebra and inequalities to get started.**

Below is every reason why you need to give JavaScript a shot, even if you weren’t the brightest in the room during math classes.

## JavaScript is not Math It’s a Language

When it comes to software development it's all about creativity more than anything. You don’t get restricted to work within a certain parameter or thought. You can always change and shift your workings according to the project at hand.

Note that when working on math problems, there is always a singular answer. The point is simple; either you are right or wrong in your calculation. However, you get to have several approaches towards a similar subject with JavaScript.

Once you understand the fundamentals, the sky is the limit. You can always manipulate the workings even when dealing with a new programming language. Note that you can master other languages easily once you understand JavaScript.

## The Program Runs the Math

The first computers were mostly regarded as glorified calculators rather than anything else. However, computer languages have revolutionized the way that computers work. Everything is already laid out and all you need to do is input data and parameters. You don’t need to carry out any calculations when using JavaScript.

Understand that several tools within JavaScript can handle all the strenuous math tasks. Programmers have been working night and day to write several lines of code within the languages. Users can, therefore, be more productive thanks to tools such as frameworks, libraries, and IDEs.

## You Don’t Need to learn Everything at Once

Most would-be coders, make the big mistake of thinking that they need to learn everything all at once. What you must understand is that learning JavaScript is like riding a bike. It might have a few bumps and falls at first, but you will soon get a hang of it.

Think of it this way: product assembly contractors don’t need to know all the complexities of building the individual parts. The same way that McDonald's employees don’t have to know how to cook an entire meal to justify their job.

Note that programming is an ideal choice for all individuals who have a passion for problem-solving. As stated earlier, most of the code lines are already designed. Once you learn how the program works, you can solve any problem you have.

An excellent example is Aaron Edell, Machine Box founder, and self-taught programmer. Understand that this is an individual who started learning programming late in life. It is also worth mentioning that he didn’t have any background in computer science. According to him, all he needed was a defined problem to solve and not an understanding of math.

## You Drive Your Car Without Understanding How the Engine Works

You don’t need any skills in math to start learning how to program today. You can pick up the few basics, such as addition and subtraction, as you go along. According to John Hopkins, a lecturer at Yaakov Chaikin, teachers make a huge mistake of introducing programming by using math. Note that coding is a separate entity from math.

Most people that drive cars have no idea about the workings of the engine. It isn’t of much concern to learn about how the internal combustion of your car engine works. In the same way, you can learn JavaScript without knowing much about math.

## Google is Your Friend

Today, there is no problem that Google can’t help you solve. If you run into a problem with JavaScript, then the chances are that some other people have also run into the same problem. You already know by now that developers are an open and transparent community.

You will, therefore, find pages that offer solutions to the problem that you have. Understand that Google is a huge advantage that wasn’t necessarily available to the first developers. These developers had to work everything out by themselves whenever they got stuck.

According to Victoria Fine from Slate, one of the unsaid secrets of learning coding is being a good Googler. The good news is that you will always get pointers to help you work out any glitches that you may encounter. Even without an exact solution, the help of other developers with a similar problem can point you in the right direction.

All you need to do is figure out the right terms to use when Googling. You will, therefore, refine your search parameter to get you the right answers. Start by learning the vocabulary of JavaScript to ensure you make the most from Google.

## Many Developers are Thriving Without a Background in Math

Catalina Astengo, Nav.com developer, was startled on her first tech job when she realized that most of her colleagues had a background in literature and music. She expected to find a majority of her colleagues with a background in Math. She went further to document that she hasn’t used any advanced math calculations since she started web development.

Alex Hughes says he was poor at math while in school. However, this fact has never held him back in language programming. According to him, anyone that knows the timetable and can count to ten is ready to start learning JavaScript.

## Conclusion

All you need to start learning JavaScript is a basic understanding of math; subtraction, addition, and multiplication. You don’t need to learn any of the complexities including probability, graphs, equations, derivatives, and so on. I would advise you to start learning JavaScript if you are a logical thinker that is interested in problem-solving.
